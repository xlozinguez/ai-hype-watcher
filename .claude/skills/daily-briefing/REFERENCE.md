# Daily Briefing — Reference Material

## Briefing Structure

Each briefing follows a consistent format designed for quick scanning with optional deep reading.

### Tone
- Informative but opinionated — take a clear position on significance
- Skeptical where warranted — flag hype, unsubstantiated claims, and marketing posture
- Practical — emphasize what matters for working engineers, not industry spectators

### Length Guidelines
- Headlines section: 3-5 items, one line each
- Detail sections: 1-2 paragraphs per headline item
- Total briefing: 500-1500 words (concise is better)

## Topic Categories

Tag briefing items with these categories for easy filtering:

| Category | Covers |
|----------|--------|
| `tools` | New releases, updates, feature announcements |
| `patterns` | New workflows, architectural patterns, best practices |
| `economics` | Infrastructure costs, funding, market dynamics |
| `security` | Vulnerabilities, attack vectors, safety research |
| `critical` | Hype checks, contrarian takes, bubble indicators |
| `research` | Papers, benchmarks, capability evaluations |
| `ecosystem` | Community developments, marketplace changes, policy |

## Search Strategies

When auto-searching for news, use these query patterns:

### High-Signal Sources
- Anthropic blog, OpenAI blog, Google DeepMind blog
- Hacker News front page (AI-related)
- AI-focused YouTube channels already tracked in sources/
- ArXiv cs.AI and cs.SE (recent papers with practical implications)

### Effective Search Queries
- `"claude code" OR "claude agent" site:news.ycombinator.com` (last 7 days)
- `AI coding tools update 2026` (current month)
- `AI agent orchestration new` (last 7 days)
- `AI infrastructure economics` (last 30 days)
- `AI security vulnerability agent` (last 7 days)

## Cross-Referencing Guidelines

When connecting briefing items to existing sources:
- Reference by source ID and brief title: "Relates to [#007: Super Bowl Bubble Curse](../sources/007-internet-of-bugs-ai-bubble.md)"
- Note whether the new finding supports, contradicts, or extends the existing source's argument
- Flag items that warrant a full source note (use the `/synthesize-source` skill later)
