# Module 02: Prompting & Workflows

> Master prompt engineering fundamentals and build sticky, reusable AI workflows that compound over time.

## Overview

Effective AI-assisted development starts with effective communication. This module covers prompt engineering frameworks, the shift from ad-hoc chatting to systematic workflows, specification-first development, and validation techniques that prevent hallucination-driven failures.

## Prerequisites

- [Module 01: Foundations](../01-foundations/README.md)

## Key Topics

- Prompt engineering frameworks (Role → Task → Context → Examples → Output → Constraints)
- Sticky AI workflows (prompt libraries, text expanders, persistent projects)
- Specification as the new bottleneck
- Context window discipline
- Validation and cross-model verification
- The vibe coding spectrum (play vs. production)
