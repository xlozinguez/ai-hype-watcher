# Module 01: Foundations

> Understand the current AI landscape, the gap between capability and adoption, and how to separate genuine progress from hype.

## Overview

Before diving into specific tools and patterns, it's essential to understand the broader context: what AI coding tools can actually do today, how fast the landscape is changing, and where the hype outpaces reality. This module builds the mental models needed to evaluate AI developments with informed skepticism.

## Prerequisites

None — this is the starting module.

## Key Topics

- The AI capability landscape (model releases, benchmarks, what they mean)
- The capability overhang (gap between what's available and what's adopted)
- Hype cycle dynamics (bubble indicators, historical patterns)
- Phase transitions in autonomous coding duration
- The acceleration curve and its implications
