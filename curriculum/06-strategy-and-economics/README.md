# Module 06: Strategy & Economics

> Navigate the business side of AI adoption — infrastructure economics, the AI-driven SDLC, security risks, and hype-aware strategy.

## Overview

AI tools don't exist in a vacuum. This module covers the strategic and economic context: why inference infrastructure is physically constrained, how the software development lifecycle is being restructured, the security risks emerging in the agent ecosystem, and how to build an adoption strategy that's grounded in reality rather than hype.

## Prerequisites

None — this module can be taken alongside any other module.

## Key Topics

- Anthropic's "do more with less" philosophy and enterprise market position
- The global inference crisis (DRAM, HBM, TSMC, GPU constraints)
- Infrastructure economics (token costs at scale, efficiency as competitive advantage)
- The AI-driven SDLC (bottleneck shift from writing to evaluating code)
- Skills ecosystem security (supply chain attacks, hallucination squatting)
- Revenue-per-employee at AI-native companies
- Role convergence and "software-shaped intent"
- Bubble dynamics and contrarian indicators
