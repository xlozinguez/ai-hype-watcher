# Module 03: Claude Code Essentials

> Set up Claude Code effectively — CLAUDE.md configuration, the skills system, and context management fundamentals.

## Overview

Claude Code is a powerful CLI for AI-assisted development, but its effectiveness depends on proper configuration. This module covers the practical setup: how to write effective CLAUDE.md files, when and how to use skills (the composability primitive), and how to manage context windows to maintain quality across long sessions.

## Prerequisites

- [Module 01: Foundations](../01-foundations/README.md)
- [Module 02: Prompting & Workflows](../02-prompting-and-workflows/README.md)

## Key Topics

- CLAUDE.md as the project brain (structure, rules, conventions)
- Skills system: the composability hierarchy (prompts → sub-agents → skills)
- When to use skills vs. MCP servers vs. sub-agents
- Context window management and progressive disclosure
- Skills as CLAUDE.md relief (moving workflow context into discoverable skills)
- Project-level vs. global skills
