# 141: Harvard Thinking: Preserving learning in the age of AI shortcuts

> **Creator**: Harvard University | **Platform**: YouTube | **Date**: 2026-02-19 | **Duration**: 28:23

## Summary

A Harvard Thinking podcast episode bringing together three Harvard faculty members -- Michael Brenner (applied mathematics/Google), Tina Grotzer (cognitive science/education), and Dean Shu (AI and children's development) -- to discuss how generative AI is reshaping education. The panel grapples with a fundamental tension: AI is an indispensable professional tool that students must learn to use, yet over-reliance on it threatens the development of critical thinking, self-regulation, and metacognitive skills.

The conversation surfaces concrete evidence of the problem: a survey of 7,000 high school students found nearly half felt they were over-relying on AI, with over 40% reporting failed attempts to limit their own usage. The panelists also highlight how AI is eroding student motivation in core subjects like math and English, forcing a rethinking of education's purpose. Rather than banning AI, they advocate for redesigning assignments to push students beyond what AI can do, emphasizing metacognition, human relationships, and the irreplaceable social-emotional dimensions of learning.

## Key Concepts

### The Self-Regulation Crisis ([07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXp59FDQ_3o&t=466))

A survey of 7,000 high school students revealed that nearly half felt they were over-relying on AI for learning. Over 40% said they tried to limit their AI usage but failed -- drawing parallels to technology addiction. Students can self-identify the problem but lack the self-regulation skills to resist the convenience AI offers, especially for younger learners who haven't yet developed these cognitive capacities.

### Redesigning Assignments to Outrun AI ([08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXp59FDQ_3o&t=521))

Brenner describes completely overhauling his Harvard applied mathematics course after discovering Gemini could solve his entire problem set. Instead of traditional homework, students were tasked with *inventing* problems that chatbots couldn't solve, verifying solutions numerically, and convincing classmates of their correctness. By semester's end, the class of 60 had generated 600 problems beyond chatbot capability. Oral exams replaced written finals, requiring students to explain their reasoning at the blackboard. Brenner reports students learned more deeply than any prior cohort.

### Metacognition as the New Educational Purpose ([15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXp59FDQ_3o&t=903))

Grotzer argues that metacognition -- understanding and thinking about your own thinking -- should become a central purpose of education. Students need to understand what human embodied minds do better than AI and what AI does better, creating a conscious framework for task delegation. This isn't a one-time lesson but an ongoing practice as AI capabilities shift, making the human-AI boundary a constantly moving target.

### The Irreplaceable Social-Emotional Dimension ([19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXp59FDQ_3o&t=1141))

Shu's research comparing AI tutors to human tutors found similar retention of factual information, but students reported significantly higher enjoyment and engagement with human tutors. In a separate experiment, identical essay feedback was attributed either to the instructor or to AI -- students rated instructor-attributed feedback as significantly more useful. The social relationship, the sense that someone cares about your success, is an irreplaceable ingredient in learning that AI cannot replicate.

### Machines Talking to Machines ([19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXp59FDQ_3o&t=1141))

Grotzer describes a cautionary anecdote: a student used AI to write an essay, and the professor used AI to respond. The feedback was polished but meaningless -- neither party had engaged with the content. This "machines talking to machines" scenario represents the ultimate failure mode of AI in education, where the purpose of learning is entirely lost.

## Practical Takeaways

- **Raise the bar, don't lower it**: AI should be a reason for students to tackle harder problems, not easier ones. Assignments should push beyond what chatbots can solve.
- **Teach metacognition explicitly**: Students need structured practice in understanding what their minds do well versus what AI does well, and this boundary shifts constantly.
- **Preserve human relationships in education**: AI can deliver information but cannot replace the motivational, social-emotional scaffolding that human teachers and tutors provide.
- **Measure learning outcomes, not just output**: When experimenting with AI in education, institutions need empirical evidence that students are actually learning more, not just producing more.

## Notable Quotes

> "I think that because we have AI, students should do more. They should solve harder problems. They should learn more." — Michael Brenner ([08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXp59FDQ_3o&t=521))

> "We asked them, do you feel that you are relying on AI too much for your learning? And almost half of those students said yes. And then over 40% said that I actually tried to limit my usage, but it was so difficult I failed." — Dean Shu ([07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXp59FDQ_3o&t=466))

> "The machines are talking to the machines at that point and then we've truly lost the purpose of education." — Tina Grotzer ([19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXp59FDQ_3o&t=1141))

> "There's a real question in my mind about whether we should be teaching people how to program computers at all." — Michael Brenner ([17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXp59FDQ_3o&t=1024))
