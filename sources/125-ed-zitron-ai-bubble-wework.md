# 125: AI Bubble: 'This is dumber than WeWork' - Ed Zitron

> **Creator**: The Tech Report | **Platform**: YouTube | **Date**: 2026-02-20 | **Duration**: 26:37

## Summary

Ed Zitron, writer of Where's Your Ed At and host of the Better Offline podcast, delivers a scathing economic analysis of the AI industry, arguing it is a repeat of the WeWork bubble but with worse fundamentals. He cites a National Bureau of Economic Research study of 6,000 CEOs showing 90% saw no impact on employment or productivity from AI adoption in the past three years. His central thesis: if AI was going to help, it would have helped already — over a trillion dollars has been invested since 2022 with no measurable productivity gains.

Zitron dismantles the financial structures underlying AI companies. OpenAI needs far more than its $100B+ fundraise — it owes $300B to Oracle, has committed to $450B+ in compute spending, and its subscription pricing is deeply subsidized (Claude Max users consume 8-13x their subscription cost in API calls). Anthropic faces similar math: $30B raised against projected $160B in compute costs over three years. He compares SoftBank's $30B investment in OpenAI directly to its WeWork debacle, noting that at least WeWork had physical real estate assets — OpenAI and Anthropic have "very few assets" beyond talent. The conversation becomes a structural indictment of an industry that Zitron says is propped up by circular capital flows between big tech companies and their AI subsidiaries.

## Key Concepts

### The WeWork 2.0 Thesis ([20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_3X6qF2tT4&t=1200))

Zitron argues the AI bubble is structurally identical to WeWork but worse. WeWork at least had leases and real estate — tangible assets to pick apart in bankruptcy. OpenAI and Anthropic have few hard assets, making the eventual unwinding potentially more destructive. Both companies use what Zitron calls "community adjusted EBITDA" — creative accounting to obscure unsustainable economics.

### The Productivity Mirage ([01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_3X6qF2tT4&t=60))

A National Bureau of Economic Research study of 6,000 CEOs found 90% saw no impact on employment or productivity from AI. Despite over $1 trillion invested since 2022, executives only project 1.4% productivity gains over the next three years. Zitron draws a parallel to the early computer era, where the "information revolution" initially slowed productivity due to information overload — the same dynamic he sees with AI-generated content.

### Forced Adoption vs. Organic Demand ([04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_3X6qF2tT4&t=270))

Unlike the iPhone, which spread through "shadow IT" as employees demanded to use their own devices, AI adoption is being forced top-down. Google renamed Google Assistant to Gemini on every device; Microsoft embedded Copilot into Windows 11 and Office 365. Usage figures are inflated by counting every user who sees a popup as an "active user." Accenture is now tying performance evaluations to AI usage. Zitron argues genuine utility never requires this kind of coercion.

### The Subsidy Trap ([15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_3X6qF2tT4&t=900))

AI products are deeply subsidized to speed-run revenue growth. Claude Max subscribers consume 8-13x their subscription cost in API calls. Sustainable pricing would require "hundreds of dollars a week or even a day." These subsidies create an illusion of product-market fit while burning through capital at an unsustainable rate. The J-curve defense (heavy investment now, payoff later) keeps getting extended further into the future.

### Circular Capital Flows ([17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_3X6qF2tT4&t=1020))

Amazon investing in OpenAI while OpenAI commits to spend $250B on Amazon Web Services is described as "taking a tenner out of your wallet and putting it back in." Microsoft invested in both Anthropic and OpenAI. These circular capital structures create the appearance of a functioning market while the same money circulates between a handful of companies — a dynamic Zitron says a functioning SEC should investigate.

## Practical Takeaways

- **Demand proof, not projections**: When AI companies promise future productivity gains, ask for current measurable evidence. The J-curve defense is unfalsifiable — it always extends further out.
- **Distinguish forced adoption from real demand**: Usage growth driven by embedding AI into existing products (Google, Microsoft) is not evidence of product-market fit.
- **Examine subscription economics**: If a product costs 8-13x more to deliver than what users pay, the pricing model is unsustainable and current adoption rates are misleading.
- **Watch the debt structure**: AI infrastructure investment increasingly relies on private credit and bank lending. When the credit cycle turns, the cascade effects will be severe.
- **Compare to WeWork, not to AWS**: AWS cost $69B over 9 years before going cash-flow positive. OpenAI is raising more than that in a single year. The comparison that matters is not AWS but WeWork.

## Notable Quotes

> "If AI was gonna help, it would have been helping already." — Ed Zitron ([03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_3X6qF2tT4&t=210))

> "This is WeWork too except it's so much worse. WeWork, they had leases, they had real estate... OpenAI and Anthropic actually have very few assets." — Ed Zitron ([22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_3X6qF2tT4&t=1320))

> "It's Wile E. Coyote running at full speed. Don't look down, because the moment you look down and think about the numbers... you go, 'Huh, but none of this is very good, and it doesn't seem to be getting better.'" — Ed Zitron ([18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_3X6qF2tT4&t=1080))

> "Profitability is revenue minus COGS, Dario." — Ed Zitron ([22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_3X6qF2tT4&t=1350))
