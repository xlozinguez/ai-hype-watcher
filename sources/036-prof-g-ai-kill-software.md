# 036: Did AI Just Kill Software?

> **Creator**: Prof G Markets (Scott Galloway & Ed Elson) | **Platform**: YouTube | **Date**: 2026-02-09 | **Duration**: 1:12:36

## Summary

Scott Galloway and Ed Elson analyze the dramatic selloff in software stocks following a wave of new AI product announcements from Anthropic and OpenAI. The software ETF (IGV) dropped 20% in a single month, with individual names like Shopify falling 14% and Adobe nearly 40% over the past year. Galloway and Elson argue this is panic selling reminiscent of Google's 40% crash when ChatGPT launched — a crash that preceded a 280% run-up — and that enterprise switching costs make the "software is dead" narrative overblown.

The episode also covers Anthropic's Super Bowl ad, which Galloway calls a seminal moment in the AI wars. The ad attacked OpenAI's decision to introduce advertising into ChatGPT, and Galloway frames it as a textbook "laddering" strategy — finding differentiation that is relevant, sustainable, and resonant. He predicts Anthropic will surpass OpenAI in valuation within 12 months, driven by its enterprise-first strategy versus OpenAI's consumer orientation.

Note: This is a multi-topic Prof G Markets episode. Only the AI-relevant segments are synthesized here (software selloff discussion and Anthropic Super Bowl ad analysis).

## Key Concepts

### AI-Driven Software Selloff Is Panic, Not Fundamentals ([07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERAoSEC4skY&t=420))

Software stocks lost roughly 12% of value in a single week after Anthropic rolled out industry-specific products (legal, finance, customer service) and OpenAI launched multi-agent coding tools and an enterprise deployment platform. The forward P/E for software companies dropped from 35x in 2025 to 20x — the lowest since 2014. Galloway and Elson compare this to two historical precedents: Google's stock cratering 40% when ChatGPT launched (before rising 280%) and Meta falling 70% when TikTok emerged (before rising 600%). In both cases, the incumbents integrated the disruptive technology and came out stronger.

### Enterprise Switching Costs as a Moat ([13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERAoSEC4skY&t=780))

The core bull case for incumbent software companies rests on enterprise switching costs. Terminating an enterprise SaaS contract requires committee approval, takes over six months to find a replacement, and often requires paying 100% of remaining contract fees. Galloway uses Salesforce and Oracle as examples — companies that intentionally create friction to exit. Even if an AI startup offers 80% of the functionality at 10% of the price, the behavioral and organizational inertia of thousands of employees trained on existing systems makes wholesale replacement unlikely. The more probable outcome: procurement departments use AI alternatives as leverage to negotiate lower prices, creating margin compression rather than extinction.

### Margin Compression, Not Extinction ([08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERAoSEC4skY&t=510))

Galloway draws a useful distinction: AI won't kill incumbent software companies, but it will compress their margins. A wave of overfunded startups with 10-30 person teams can now spin up SaaS platforms at a fraction of the cost. He uses a tiered analogy: Adobe is Mercedes, Figma is Toyota, and someone will use AI to build the BYD — 80% of the product for 10% of the price. This creates negotiating leverage for enterprise buyers without requiring them to actually switch. The incumbents that integrate AI into their own products will survive; the ones that don't (he singles out Gartner, down 72% in a year) will be vulnerable to activists demanding headcount cuts.

### Anthropic's Super Bowl Ad as a Seminal Moment ([56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERAoSEC4skY&t=3360))

Galloway calls Anthropic's Super Bowl ad — which satirized AI-inserted advertising in ChatGPT — the biggest moment in broadcast advertising's impact on markets in a long time, and compares it to Apple's iconic 1984 ad. He applies his brand strategy framework of "laddering" (differentiation, relevance, sustainability) to Anthropic's positioning: (1) Differentiated — Anthropic commits to no ads while OpenAI introduces them; (2) Relevant — people are sharing their most intimate information with AI, and the thought of that being monetized via ads is genuinely alarming; (3) Sustainable — OpenAI's revenue projections likely make it difficult to reverse course on ads. He specifically notes that the number one use case for AI at corporations is therapy and personal queries, making the ad-free promise especially resonant.

### OpenAI's Strategic Missteps ([61:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERAoSEC4skY&t=3690))

Sam Altman's public response to the Anthropic ad — a lengthy defensive essay on Twitter — is analyzed as a textbook PR mistake. Galloway invokes competitive positioning 101: when you're the market leader, you never reference the competition. Hertz never referenced Avis. Coke never referenced Pepsi. By responding at length, Altman signaled fear. His only move should have been: "I've seen it. It's a great ad. Good for them." This, combined with Altman reversing his position on ads ("a last resort") and porn, erodes trust in OpenAI's stated principles.

### Anthropic vs OpenAI: Enterprise vs Consumer ([71:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERAoSEC4skY&t=4260))

Galloway draws a historical parallel to Dell vs Gateway in the early 2000s: Gateway went consumer and Dell went enterprise (small/medium business). Anthropic has pursued the enterprise market while OpenAI has built a consumer business. Galloway predicts that within 12 months, Anthropic (currently raising at $350B) will surpass OpenAI (claiming $850B) in valuation. This represents a significant directional bet from a widely-followed markets commentator.

## Practical Takeaways

- **Software selloff = buying opportunity, not obituary**: When an entire sector sells off on narrative rather than fundamentals, look for "dislocated high-quality companies" (DHQs) — strong businesses trading at distressed multiples. Adobe at 17x earnings vs its 5-year average of 37x is the kind of dislocation that historically precedes major recoveries.
- **Switching costs are the real moat**: Before assuming AI kills an incumbent, audit the switching costs. Enterprise SaaS with deep organizational integration (Salesforce, ServiceNow, Adobe) has structural protection that consumer products (OnlyFans, Gartner research reports) do not.
- **Margin compression is the actual threat**: The more realistic disruption model is not replacement but negotiating leverage — AI alternatives give procurement departments ammunition to demand lower prices from incumbents.
- **Brand positioning matters in AI**: Anthropic's no-ads commitment is a masterclass in competitive positioning. For AI companies, trust and privacy are becoming core brand differentiators, not just features.
- **Never punch down as the market leader**: OpenAI's defensive response to Anthropic's ad violated basic competitive positioning principles and amplified the challenger's message.

## Notable Quotes

> "The market's reaction has not been one of we're going to see reduced margins. The market's reaction is telling us software is dead. AI has killed software." — Ed Elson ([10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERAoSEC4skY&t=600))

> "Somebody's going to come up with BYD and that is they're going to use AI to come up with 80% of Adobe for 10% of the price." — Scott Galloway ([08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERAoSEC4skY&t=510))

> "If you're going to cancel an enterprise contract with a software company, say Salesforce, that's not like a small deal. That's like a gigantic pain in the ass. The switching costs are massive." — Ed Elson ([13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERAoSEC4skY&t=810))

> "This is the biggest moment in broadcast advertising as it relates to impact on the markets we've seen in a long time. This is the moment that Anthropic begins an ascent in valuation past OpenAI." — Scott Galloway ([58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERAoSEC4skY&t=3480))

> "People are revealing their most intimate questions and concerns to AI. And the thought that this person is going to take all your personal information and start saying, 'Oh, you seem to be suffering from depression. Have you thought about Lexapro?'" — Scott Galloway ([59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERAoSEC4skY&t=3570))

> "Anthropic has gone enterprise, OpenAI has built a consumer business... within 12 months, Anthropic is going to be worth more than OpenAI." — Scott Galloway ([71:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERAoSEC4skY&t=4290))
