# 151: Microsoft Copilot's $13B Adoption Failure — 3.3% Uptake at 450M Seats

## Summary

Logically Answered examines Microsoft Copilot's commercial failure despite massive investment and aggressive distribution. Out of 450 million Microsoft 365 seats, only 3.3% have paid for Copilot. Microsoft has committed over $13 billion to OpenAI and is spending $30+ billion per quarter on AI infrastructure, yet the product consistently underperforms user expectations — often refusing to perform actions and instead providing instructions for users to do things themselves.

The video highlights a particularly damning signal: Microsoft's own software engineers were instructed to evaluate both Claude Code and GitHub Copilot, with teams responsible for Windows, Office, Edge, and Surface all told to use Claude. Microsoft also signed an Anthropic deal giving Azure customers access to Claude models. The piece argues this represents one of Microsoft's biggest product missteps, with the company resorting to forcing Copilot into existing subscriptions through price increases rather than earning adoption through quality.

## Key Concepts

### The Adoption Gap

Despite 70% of Fortune 500 companies technically "adopting" Copilot, only 6% completed enterprise-wide rollouts. The vast majority remain in pilot or limited deployment — suggesting companies tried it and found it insufficient to justify broad deployment at $30/seat/month.

### Forced Adoption Strategy

When voluntary adoption failed, Microsoft pivoted to bundling Copilot into personal and family 365 plans with significant price increases (45% for personal, 29% for family). The classic non-Copilot plan was hidden behind the cancellation flow. The Australian government sued Microsoft over this practice for a penalty above $50 million AUD.

### Internal Credibility Crisis

Microsoft's own employees are paying out of pocket for ChatGPT rather than using Copilot. The decision to have internal engineering teams evaluate Claude Code alongside GitHub Copilot suggests Microsoft leadership recognizes the product's competitive weakness, even while marketing it as "the future of coding."

### The Worse-ChatGPT Problem

Copilot is built on OpenAI models with Microsoft modifications, but users consistently rate it below ChatGPT (86% vs 97% for ease of use, 86% vs 93% for meeting requirements). Users describe it as a "dumpster fire" that "struggles with the basics."

## Practical Takeaways

- **Enterprise AI adoption is far slower than vendors claim**: High-level "adoption" numbers (70% of Fortune 500) mask shallow trial deployments with minimal actual usage
- **AI product quality matters more than distribution**: Even Microsoft's dominant market position cannot force adoption of a product users find inferior
- **Watch what companies do, not what they say**: Microsoft marketing Copilot as revolutionary while internally evaluating competitors reveals the true state of the product
- **AI infrastructure spending doesn't guarantee product-market fit**: $80B+ in projected spending doesn't help if the product doesn't work well enough for users
