# 039: SaaSpocalypse: investors overspend badly and blame AI

> **Creator**: Pivot to AI (David Gerard) | **Platform**: YouTube | **Date**: 2026-02-12 | **Duration**: 7:35

## Summary

David Gerard analyzes the "SaaSpocalypse" — a sharp selloff in enterprise SaaS stocks triggered by Anthropic's launch of Claude Co-work and its industry-specific skills for legal officers. Despite Co-work being labeled a "research preview" (meaning even Anthropic didn't consider it production-ready), the announcement was enough to panic investors. Legal software companies dropped 4-12% in a single day, cascading into 20% declines across the broader SaaS sector.

Gerard argues the selloff was the bursting of a mini-bubble in overvalued software companies that analysts had flagged for some time — AI was merely the trigger, not the cause. The underlying investor thesis — that AI agents or vibe coding could replace enterprise software — is dismissed as fundamentally impossible. AI agents hallucinate and fail over time, and vibe coding cannot meet the accuracy and compliance requirements of enterprise software. However, Gerard acknowledges that the resentment toward rent-seeking enterprise software is real and vast, creating fertile ground for AI promises even when those promises cannot be delivered.

## Key Concepts

### The SaaSpocalypse: Overvaluation Meets AI Panic ([0:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYFmohEZHw&t=30))

A cluster of overvalued enterprise SaaS companies experienced sharp declines after Anthropic released Claude Co-work and legal-specific AI skills. The selloff was disproportionate to the actual product release — a research preview, not a shipping product. Gerard frames this as investors being "deluded into thinking your boss yelling at Claude Code might replace Salesforce." The crash reflects a broader pattern where stock traders, saturated with AI hype, extrapolate narrow product announcements into existential threats to entire sectors.

### AI Agents Don't Work ([3:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYFmohEZHw&t=210))

Gerard makes a blunt assessment: AI agents "literally don't work" for the use cases investors are pricing in. The failure mode is fundamental — chatbot-based agents hallucinate, and their reliability degrades over longer task chains. He points to the legal AI space specifically, noting that law firms are already hiring more lawyers to clean up after AI-generated errors. The vendor strategy is to "sell you on the vision and teach you to make excuses for the bot" while promising the next model will fix everything.

### The Vibe Coding Illusion ([5:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYFmohEZHw&t=300))

The market thesis assumes managers can vibe code enterprise replacements, but Gerard argues this is a fundamental misunderstanding. Managers "think the app's 95% done when the web page looks about right" and plan to hand it off to a developer for actual functionality. This won't be experienced developers using AI for autocomplete — it's non-technical people attempting to build software that requires accuracy and compliance, which vibe coding cannot deliver.

### Enterprise Software as Rent-Seeking ([2:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYFmohEZHw&t=150))

Gerard frames enterprise SaaS companies as "bridge trolls" — rent-seeking middlemen who charge subscription fees for software that is deliberately kept mediocre because customers have no choice. The vendors "don't even have to make the software very good, so they don't." This creates genuine and deep customer resentment that Anthropic is selling into. However, the business model is also structurally durable — the "bridge troll model is odious, but it's also a pretty solid cash flow" — and software stocks were already recovering at time of recording.

### Resentment as a Market Force ([4:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DYFmohEZHw&t=270))

The reason AI promises gain traction despite not working is that enterprise software customers genuinely hate their vendors. Gerard identifies this resentment as the key driver: "The customers want nothing more than to make these parasites go away." This creates a market dynamic where customers will "resort to vibe code that doesn't actually work either" — choosing a broken alternative over a hated incumbent, which is irrational but emotionally understandable.

## Practical Takeaways

- **Distinguish trigger from cause**: The SaaS selloff was caused by overvaluation, not by AI capabilities. AI announcements merely triggered a correction that analysts had been predicting.
- **Research previews are not products**: Anthropic explicitly labeled Co-work as a research preview, yet investors treated it as a market-ready disruption. Assess actual product readiness, not press releases.
- **AI legal tools are creating more work, not less**: Law firms adopting AI for contract review are hiring more lawyers to clean up errors — a pattern likely to repeat across compliance-heavy domains.
- **Vibe coding has a compliance ceiling**: Enterprise software requires accuracy and regulatory compliance that vibe coding fundamentally cannot deliver. The "95% done" illusion when a web page looks right masks the remaining 95% of actual work.
- **Customer resentment is real but not actionable yet**: The hatred of enterprise SaaS is genuine and creates demand for alternatives, but the AI alternatives don't work. This gap between desire and capability is where hype thrives.
