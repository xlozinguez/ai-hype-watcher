# 007: Super Bowl Commercial Bubble Curse: AIs Imitate Dot-Coms

> **Creator**: Carl Brown (Internet of Bugs) | **Platform**: YouTube | **Date**: 2026-02-08 | **Duration**: N/A

## Summary

Carl Brown, a veteran software developer and host of the Internet of Bugs YouTube channel, examines the historical pattern of tech industry Super Bowl advertising as a leading indicator of bubble bursts. The video draws a direct line from the "Dot-Com Super Bowl" of 2000 through the "Crypto Bowl" of 2022 to Super Bowl LX in 2026, where AI companies accounted for 23% of all ads (15 out of 66 commercials).

Brown argues that AI companies are repeating the exact same playbook as dot-com startups and crypto firms before them, and that this pattern should be treated as a serious warning signal. The video also acknowledges important counter-arguments -- notably that the major AI investors (Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon) are not unprofitable startups but companies with the strongest balance sheets in the market, suggesting survivors of any correction would likely be the large incumbents, not speculative startups.

## Key Concepts

### The "Dot-Com Super Bowl" (Super Bowl XXXIV, January 2000)

Super Bowl XXXIV became known as the "Dot-Com Super Bowl." At the height of the late-1990s internet boom, 14 dot-com companies each spent roughly $2 million for a 30-second ad spot, representing about 20% of all ads that night. At least 8 of the 14 companies that advertised went out of business within a few years. Notable examples include Pets.com (spent $17M in marketing for $8.8M in revenue, folded by November 2000) and Computer.com (spent roughly half of its $7M seed capital on Super Bowl ads alone). Only AutoTrader.com, Monster.com, and WebMD survived independently.

### The "Crypto Bowl" (Super Bowl LVI, February 2022)

Super Bowl LVI featured a wave of cryptocurrency advertisements. FTX ran an ad with Larry David telling viewers "don't miss out" on crypto -- less than a year later, FTX collapsed and founder Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted of fraud. Combined estimated spending by crypto companies was approximately $54 million. The crypto market began its dramatic collapse later that year. No major crypto brand returned to the Super Bowl in 2023.

### The "AI Bowl" -- Super Bowl LX (February 9, 2026)

Super Bowl LX, held in the San Francisco Bay Area, featured 15 out of 66 commercials (23%) either promoting AI companies or using AI in their creation. Major advertisers included Anthropic (four satirical spots attacking OpenAI's plan to put ads in ChatGPT), OpenAI (promoting Codex), Google (Gemini), Amazon (Alexa+), Meta (Oakley AI Glasses), Genspark (Matthew Broderick reprising Ferris Bueller), and ai.com (founded by Crypto.com's CEO Kris Marszalek, which spent $85M total and had its servers crash under traffic).

### The Pattern: Super Bowl as Bubble Indicator

| Year | Super Bowl | Dominant Tech Sector | % of Ads | What Happened Next |
|------|-----------|---------------------|----------|-------------------|
| 2000 | XXXIV | Dot-com companies | ~20% | Dot-com crash began March 2000. Most advertisers bankrupt within 2 years. |
| 2007-08 | XLI-XLII | Mortgage lenders | Significant | 2008 financial crisis and housing collapse |
| 2022 | LVI | Cryptocurrency | Major presence | Crypto crash in 2022. FTX collapsed. No crypto returned in 2023. |
| 2026 | LX | AI companies | 23% | TBD |

When a tech sector becomes flush enough with cash (often venture capital or speculative investment) to justify $8-10 million per 30-second Super Bowl ad slot, it may be near peak hype and overvaluation.

### Structural Parallels Across Bubble Cycles

- **Valuation metrics divorced from reality:** Dot-coms measured "eyeballs," crypto measured "total value locked," AI measures "model parameters" and benchmark scores. None correspond directly to revenue or profit.
- **Massive capital burn:** OpenAI reportedly loses $13.5 billion on $4.3 billion in revenue. JPMorgan estimates the AI sector would need $650 billion in annual revenue to justify current valuations.
- **Same people, same playbook:** The ai.com Super Bowl ad was launched by Crypto.com's CEO, making the crypto-to-AI pipeline explicit.
- **58% of global VC funding** went to AI startups in early 2025 (~$73.1 billion in Q1 alone), representing extreme sector concentration.
- **One analyst estimates** the AI bubble is 17 times bigger than the dot-com bubble and 4 times bigger than the 2008 real-estate bubble.

### Counter-Arguments and Key Differences

Important differences between AI and previous bubbles:

- **Established companies:** Unlike the dot-com era, major AI investors (Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon) have among the strongest balance sheets and highest free cash flow in the market.
- **Real enterprise adoption:** Large enterprises are deploying AI models for real tasks, unlike the dot-com era where many businesses lacked proven models.
- **Infrastructure already exists:** The internet infrastructure that survived the dot-com crash (fiber optic cables, data centers) became the foundation for the next wave. Similarly, AI infrastructure investment may retain long-term value even if a bubble pops.

These differences do not eliminate the risk -- they suggest that the survivors of an AI bubble burst would likely be the large incumbents, not the speculative startups spending $85 million on Super Bowl campaigns.

### Consumer Reaction to AI Ad Saturation

It took less than a quarter of Super Bowl LX for fans to express frustration with the volume of AI ads. Social media reaction was overwhelmingly negative, with viewers objecting to the abundance, AI-generated content perceived as "slop," and the disconnect between AI marketing promises and actual consumer experience. If the intended audience actively resents the advertising, the massive spend may be counterproductive.

## Practical Takeaways

- **Historical pattern recognition**: The Super Bowl ad concentration pattern has correctly "predicted" two previous tech busts (dot-com, crypto). Three data points do not guarantee a fourth, but the structural parallels are striking.
- **Follow the money**: When a tech sector is spending $8-10M per 30-second ad to reach a general consumer audience that may not even be the target market, it suggests the sector is optimizing for hype over product-market fit.
- **Same actors, different stage**: The literal crossover of crypto figures (Crypto.com CEO) into AI (ai.com) makes the pipeline from one bubble to the next explicit rather than merely analogical.
- **Infrastructure vs. applications**: The dot-com crash destroyed many companies but left behind valuable infrastructure (fiber, data centers). An AI correction might similarly destroy speculative startups while preserving the underlying technology for more sustainable use.
- **Consumer sentiment matters**: When your multi-million-dollar marketing campaign generates active resentment from viewers, the "awareness" you are buying may be net negative.
