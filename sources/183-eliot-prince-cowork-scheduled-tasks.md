# 183: Claude Cowork Scheduled Tasks, Skills Tab, and Video Editing

> **Creator**: Eliot Prince | **Platform**: YouTube | **Date**: 2026-02-27 | **Duration**: 9:15

## Summary

Eliot Prince walks through three new features in Claude Cowork: scheduled tasks, the consolidated "Customize" tab for skills and plugins, and the ability to edit video files. The scheduled tasks feature allows users to set up repeatable prompts that run automatically on a schedule (hourly, daily, weekly) as long as the computer is on and Cowork is open.

The video demonstrates a practical use case — automated weekly competitor research on YouTube channels, which produces a spreadsheet with channel data, video titles, view counts, and engagement metrics. The Customize tab consolidates skills, integrations, and plugins into a single location, replacing the previous scattered settings approach. Plugins bundle multiple skills and connectors into department-like AI employees (finance, marketing, customer support).

## Key Concepts

### Scheduled Tasks as Lightweight Automation

Claude Cowork now supports scheduled tasks that run automatically at set intervals. Tasks are configured with a prompt, model selection (e.g., Opus), a working folder, and a frequency (on-demand, hourly, daily, weekly with specific day/time). Tasks can be toggled on/off individually. This positions Cowork as a middle ground between manual prompting and dedicated automation platforms like Make.com or N8N.

### Consolidated Customize Tab

The new Customize tab centralizes skills, integrations (tools/connectors), and plugins in one location. Plugins are bundles of multiple skills and connectors that serve as domain-specific AI employees — for example, a marketing plugin that can create content, plan campaigns, and analyze performance. This replaces the previous workflow of navigating through settings to manage capabilities.

### Video Editing via Cowork

Cowork can perform basic video editing tasks: stitching multiple video files together, detecting and removing silences/pauses, and producing a combined output. The process takes 15-20 minutes and produces a rough first-draft quality result — not production-ready but useful for initial passes.

## Practical Takeaways

- **Scheduled tasks replace manual recurring prompts**: Any repeatable task (competitor research, inbox review, content planning) can be scheduled to run automatically on a weekly or daily cadence.
- **Computer must be on**: Scheduled tasks require the machine to be running with Cowork open — they are not cloud-hosted background jobs.
- **Plugins bundle capabilities into roles**: Rather than configuring individual skills, plugins package related tools into functional departments for more complex workflows.

## Notable Quotes

> "I never thought it would be able to edit a video till I just pointed at some video files and said, 'Do the edits for me.' And it worked." — Eliot Prince
