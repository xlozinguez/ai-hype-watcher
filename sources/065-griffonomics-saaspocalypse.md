# 065: SaaS-pocalypse: The Death of Seat-Based Software vs. The $600B AI Arms Race

> **Creator**: Griffonomics | **Platform**: YouTube | **Date**: 2026-02-13 | **Duration**: 34:39

## Summary

Griffonomics presents a deep-dive analysis of the violent bifurcation happening in the tech sector: traditional SaaS companies built on seat-based pricing are being decimated while AI infrastructure players hit all-time highs. The video frames this as a structural shift from the "tool era" to the "agentic era" of software, where AI agents replace human workers and collapse the per-seat revenue model that powered the SaaS industry for two decades.

The analysis goes beyond stock market dynamics to examine a hidden credit risk: private equity firms loaded up leveraged buyouts of "lazy SaaS" companies at 20x EBITDA valuations assuming perpetual seat growth. With that growth now stalling or reversing, software now represents 31% of all distressed names in the syndicated loan market, with PIK (payment-in-kind) usage hitting 11.3% — a systemic signal that these companies cannot service their debt. This debt is packaged into CLOs and BDCs held by pension funds and insurance companies, creating contagion risk beyond the tech sector.

The video also covers the bull case for the $600B infrastructure buildout (alive assets vs. dark fiber), the deflationary boom thesis (ARK's 6-8% GDP growth forecast), the hollow middle problem of youth unemployment as entry-level cognitive work gets automated, and a speculative thesis on Bitcoin as native currency for machine-to-machine economies.

## Key Concepts

### The Death of Seat-Based Pricing

For 15-20 years, the SaaS industry was built on a simple metric: charge per human user (seat). Revenue scaled directly with customer headcount growth. Agentic AI severs this link — if one engineer with AI agents can do the work of 3-18 engineers, the number of required software seats plummets. The video cites a theoretical scenario where 94% of seat-based revenue could be cannibalized. The Anthropic Claude Co-work plugin release triggered a flash crash in stocks like LegalZoom, Thomson Reuters, and Intuit as investors immediately grasped the implications: AI agents bypass the dashboard entirely, collapsing the value proposition of SaaS interfaces.

### Tool Era vs. Agentic Era

The video frames the market shift using a butler analogy: the tool era was about selling better washing machines (better UIs, more features for humans to operate), while the agentic era is about hiring a butler who does the work directly. Companies that merely provide "a digital form for a human to type data into" — dubbed "lazy SaaS" — face extinction. Survivors must either provide intelligence (like Palantir's ontology/data mapping) or infrastructure (orchestration layers like ServiceNow's agent governance platform). Anything in the "mushy middle" gets crushed.

### The $600B Infrastructure Arms Race — Alive Assets vs. Dark Fiber

The bear case draws parallels to the late-1990s telecom bubble where billions were spent on fiber optic cables that sat dark for years. The bull counterargument centers on "alive assets": unlike passive fiber, GPU compute is at effectively 100% utilization with a 12:1 demand-to-supply ratio. Chips are sold out before leaving the factory. The spending is framed as existential — if Google slows, Microsoft wins; if Amazon stops, AWS loses its generational dominance. The real bottleneck is not chips or money but energy, with data centers requiring gigawatts of power and driving deals like Microsoft's Three Mile Island nuclear restart.

### The Private Equity Debt Bomb

Private equity firms spent the last decade buying "boring, stable" B2B SaaS companies at ~20x EBITDA using leveraged buyouts, betting on perpetual seat growth. With the SaaS-pocalypse collapsing that growth, these companies are now worth ~9x — deeply underwater. Software represents 31% of distressed names in the syndicated loan market. PIK (payment-in-kind) usage at 11.3% means companies are paying debt by taking on more debt — the textbook definition of zombie companies. This debt is packaged into CLOs and BDCs held by pension funds, insurance companies, and endowments, creating credit market contagion risk that extends far beyond tech investors.

### The Hollow Middle — Youth Unemployment Crisis

Despite macro-optimistic GDP forecasts, the video highlights a "hollow middle" problem: youth unemployment (ages 16-24) has spiked above 10% because the entry-level cognitive work that served as the first rung of the white-collar career ladder — data entry, junior coding, report compilation — is exactly what agentic AI automates first. This breaks the apprenticeship pipeline: if young workers cannot get entry-level jobs, they never develop the skills to become senior managers or executives. The result is a wealth boom without a jobs boom.

## Practical Takeaways

- **Seat-based SaaS is structurally impaired**: Any software company whose revenue model depends on per-human-user pricing faces existential risk from agentic AI reducing headcount. The burden of proof has shifted — SaaS companies are now "guilty until proven innocent" and must demonstrate viable consumption-based or token-based pricing models.
- **Platform beats tool**: Companies that provide orchestration layers, data ontologies, or agent governance infrastructure (platform-as-a-service) are positioned to benefit from the agentic shift, while companies that merely provide dashboards for humans to operate face commoditization.
- **Watch the credit markets, not just equities**: The real systemic risk may not be in stock prices but in the leveraged loan market where PE-owned SaaS companies are accumulating distress. Software at 31% of distressed syndicated loans and 11.3% PIK usage are warning signals.
- **Vibe coding accelerates commoditization**: As AI-generated code proliferates (already ~4% of GitHub), the scarcity value of proprietary software code approaches zero, further eroding SaaS moats.
- **Infrastructure spending is the safer bet**: A barbell strategy favoring infrastructure (Nvidia, hyperscalers, energy/nuclear, grid infrastructure) on one end and proven agentic orchestrators (Palantir, potentially ServiceNow) on the other, while avoiding the "kill zone" of undifferentiated seat-based SaaS in the middle.
