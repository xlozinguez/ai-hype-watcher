# Raw Transcript: One Prompt Every AGENTIC Codebase Should Have (For Engineering Teams)

[0:00]

Do you know the simplest way to install Do you know the simplest way to install and maintain your code bases as they and maintain your code bases as they and maintain your code bases as they grow? Here's something I've learned over grow? Here's something I've learned over

grow? Here's something I've learned over 15 years of engineering with more than 15 years of engineering with more than 15 years of engineering with more than 50 plus code bases. You can tell how 50 plus code bases. You can tell how 50 plus code bases. You can tell how great an engineering team is by the time

great an engineering team is by the time great an engineering team is by the time it takes for a new engineer to run the it takes for a new engineer to run the it takes for a new engineer to run the project locally. This says a lot about project locally. This says a lot about

project locally. This says a lot about the team's growth and proficiency. And the team's growth and proficiency. And the team's growth and proficiency. And when you're joining a new team, that when you're joining a new team, that when you're joining a new team, that first interaction with the codebase and

first interaction with the codebase and first interaction with the codebase and with the team members is so important. with the team members is so important.

with the team members is so important. It really sets the stage for the new It really sets the stage for the new It really sets the stage for the new hire. For great teams, it's one link to hire. For great teams, it's one link to hire. For great teams, it's one link to one doc, a list of config file updates,

one doc, a list of config file updates, one doc, a list of config file updates, and then a few commands. For most teams and then a few commands. For most teams and then a few commands. For most teams though, it's one to two days of pair though, it's one to two days of pair

though, it's one to two days of pair programming, Slack messages, rumaging programming, Slack messages, rumaging programming, Slack messages, rumaging through outdated docs, and tons of back through outdated docs, and tons of back through outdated docs, and tons of back and forth testing. In the age of agents,

and forth testing. In the age of agents, and forth testing. In the age of agents, we can do much better than this. The we can do much better than this. The we can do much better than this. The trick is in combining scripts, docs, and trick is in combining scripts, docs, and

trick is in combining scripts, docs, and agents because agents when combined with agents because agents when combined with agents because agents when combined with code beats either alone. Cloud code code beats either alone. Cloud code code beats either alone. Cloud code released a brand new setup hook for this

released a brand new setup hook for this released a brand new setup hook for this very purpose. It's an interesting hook very purpose. It's an interesting hook very purpose. It's an interesting hook though because it doesn't show up in the though because it doesn't show up in the

though because it doesn't show up in the life cycle diagram for cloud code hooks. life cycle diagram for cloud code hooks. life cycle diagram for cloud code hooks. We're going to take this hook and push We're going to take this hook and push We're going to take this hook and push it further because when you combine

it further because when you combine it further because when you combine deterministic hooks with standardized deterministic hooks with standardized deterministic hooks with standardized agentic prompts, you get the best of agentic prompts, you get the best of

agentic prompts, you get the best of both worlds. Predictable execution, both worlds. Predictable execution, both worlds. Predictable execution, intelligent oversight, and interactivity intelligent oversight, and interactivity intelligent oversight, and interactivity when you need it. Let's discuss the best

when you need it. Let's discuss the best when you need it. Let's discuss the best way to install and maintain your code way to install and maintain your code way to install and maintain your code bases as they grow in size and value.

The first thing I want to do here is The first thing I want to do here is showcase a new powerful tool I've been showcase a new powerful tool I've been showcase a new powerful tool I've been using to guide my commands, agents, and using to guide my commands, agents, and

using to guide my commands, agents, and developer tools. Let me introduce you to developer tools. Let me introduce you to developer tools. Let me introduce you to just file. This is a simple command just file. This is a simple command just file. This is a simple command runner that serves as a launchpad for

runner that serves as a launchpad for runner that serves as a launchpad for your engineering work. You can see I your engineering work. You can see I your engineering work. You can see I have several commands set up, front end have several commands set up, front end

have several commands set up, front end setup, backend, reset artifacts, and setup, backend, reset artifacts, and setup, backend, reset artifacts, and then we have something really then we have something really then we have something really interesting. I'm kicking off many

interesting. I'm kicking off many interesting. I'm kicking off many different cloud agents with different different cloud agents with different different cloud agents with different CLI flags. With just file, you, your CLI flags. With just file, you, your

[2:03]

CLI flags. With just file, you, your team, and your agents don't need to team, and your agents don't need to team, and your agents don't need to remember or look up flags more than remember or look up flags more than remember or look up flags more than once. They just run this. If we open the

once. They just run this. If we open the once. They just run this. If we open the terminal and type just, you can see all terminal and type just, you can see all terminal and type just, you can see all the commands ready to go. This is a very the commands ready to go. This is a very

the commands ready to go. This is a very powerful tool for scaling and reusing powerful tool for scaling and reusing powerful tool for scaling and reusing your customizable agents. Let's go ahead your customizable agents. Let's go ahead your customizable agents. Let's go ahead and run our first command that activates

and run our first command that activates and run our first command that activates this new setup hook. If we type just this new setup hook. If we type just this new setup hook. If we type just cli, we're going to kick off this claw cli, we're going to kick off this claw

cli, we're going to kick off this claw code command. It doesn't look like anything happened It doesn't look like anything happened there, but this init flag changed the there, but this init flag changed the there, but this init flag changed the workflow. This init flag in fact ran the

workflow. This init flag in fact ran the workflow. This init flag in fact ran the setup hook before it booted up this full setup hook before it booted up this full setup hook before it booted up this full cloud code instance. If we look under cloud code instance. If we look under

cloud code instance. If we look under the hood here, open up the settings the hood here, open up the settings the hood here, open up the settings file, we can see we have a brand new file, we can see we have a brand new file, we can see we have a brand new setup hook. If we collapse just to our

setup hook. If we collapse just to our setup hook. If we collapse just to our setup hook, you can see we have two new setup hook, you can see we have two new setup hook, you can see we have two new options for this hook. We're matching a options for this hook. We're matching a

options for this hook. We're matching a knit and maintenance. You can see just knit and maintenance. You can see just knit and maintenance. You can see just like all of our other hooks, we're like all of our other hooks, we're like all of our other hooks, we're running a setup init command. Let's

running a setup init command. Let's running a setup init command. Let's crack that open and let's see what crack that open and let's see what crack that open and let's see what happened. We have a script that runs happened. We have a script that runs

happened. We have a script that runs several commands when we pass in d-init several commands when we pass in d-init several commands when we pass in d-init into cloud code. It's just going to run into cloud code. It's just going to run into cloud code. It's just going to run a few setup commands for us. All right,

a few setup commands for us. All right, a few setup commands for us. All right, so you can see here we have a run so you can see here we have a run so you can see here we have a run function that is actually just going to function that is actually just going to

function that is actually just going to pass this right into a terminal instance pass this right into a terminal instance pass this right into a terminal instance and execute the command. If we search and execute the command. If we search and execute the command. If we search for run here, you can see we're running

for run here, you can see we're running for run here, you can see we're running uvync mpm install and we're executing uvync mpm install and we're executing uvync mpm install and we're executing this database script. Our installation this database script. Our installation

this database script. Our installation command is doing installation work and command is doing installation work and command is doing installation work and it runs anytime we pass in this dash and it runs anytime we pass in this dash and it runs anytime we pass in this dash and flag into clawed code. This is just a

flag into clawed code. This is just a flag into clawed code. This is just a script. This is cool, but it's not that script. This is cool, but it's not that script. This is cool, but it's not that novel. Most production code bases novel. Most production code bases

novel. Most production code bases already have scripts like this set up. already have scripts like this set up. already have scripts like this set up. This is just raw deterministic code.

This is just raw deterministic code. This is just raw deterministic code. It's not that valuable. It's not that It's not that valuable. It's not that It's not that valuable. It's not that new or novel. We'll talk about how we new or novel. We'll talk about how we

new or novel. We'll talk about how we can push this to the next level in a can push this to the next level in a can push this to the next level in a moment. First, let's run our next just moment. First, let's run our next just moment. First, let's run our next just command to kick off our maintenance

command to kick off our maintenance command to kick off our maintenance workflow. Same pattern, different codebase life Same pattern, different codebase life cycle stage. We're going to clear. We'll cycle stage. We're going to clear. We'll

cycle stage. We're going to clear. We'll type just so we can see all of our type just so we can see all of our type just so we can see all of our commands that we can quickly fire off.

[4:05]

commands that we can quickly fire off. commands that we can quickly fire off. And we'll type just clmm. This is our And we'll type just clmm. This is our And we'll type just clmm. This is our deterministic codebase maintenance. It's deterministic codebase maintenance. It's

deterministic codebase maintenance. It's going to fire up cloud code and run in going to fire up cloud code and run in going to fire up cloud code and run in maintenance mode. Just like our d-init maintenance mode. Just like our d-init maintenance mode. Just like our d-init command, maintenance does something very

command, maintenance does something very command, maintenance does something very similar. You can see we're running setup similar. You can see we're running setup similar. You can see we're running setup maintenance and it's another script maintenance and it's another script

maintenance and it's another script that's running another workflow with that's running another workflow with that's running another workflow with deterministic code. You can see we have deterministic code. You can see we have deterministic code. You can see we have another log file that's going to execute

another log file that's going to execute another log file that's going to execute and append. And if we just do that exact and append. And if we just do that exact and append. And if we just do that exact same thing, you know, we have our run same thing, you know, we have our run

same thing, you know, we have our run command. We can collapse everything to command. We can collapse everything to command. We can collapse everything to see what the script looks like. Let's go see what the script looks like. Let's go see what the script looks like. Let's go ahead and look for where we're using

ahead and look for where we're using ahead and look for where we're using that run command. And you can see we're that run command. And you can see we're that run command. And you can see we're updating our backend dependencies for updating our backend dependencies for

updating our backend dependencies for this codebase. We're running mpm update. this codebase. We're running mpm update. this codebase. We're running mpm update. And then we're doing some additional And then we're doing some additional And then we're doing some additional scripting on our database. For this

scripting on our database. For this scripting on our database. For this codebase example, we're using SQLite 3. codebase example, we're using SQLite 3.

codebase example, we're using SQLite 3. Just showcasing that you could be Just showcasing that you could be Just showcasing that you could be running some type of maintenance running some type of maintenance running some type of maintenance operation, migrations, artifact cleanup,

operation, migrations, artifact cleanup, operation, migrations, artifact cleanup, so on and so forth. Right? This is where so on and so forth. Right? This is where so on and so forth. Right? This is where you run that. And again, this isn't that you run that. And again, this isn't that

you run that. And again, this isn't that interesting. Okay, it's a script that interesting. Okay, it's a script that interesting. Okay, it's a script that runs when you pass in a specific flag runs when you pass in a specific flag runs when you pass in a specific flag into starting up cloud code. It's nearly

into starting up cloud code. It's nearly into starting up cloud code. It's nearly the equivalent of just running this the equivalent of just running this the equivalent of just running this yourself. So, why is this interesting?

yourself. So, why is this interesting? yourself. So, why is this interesting? Why did the cloud code engineers build Why did the cloud code engineers build Why did the cloud code engineers build this out? Right? This is an optional this out? Right? This is an optional

this out? Right? This is an optional additional hook that runs before additional hook that runs before additional hook that runs before sessions start. Right? And to be super sessions start. Right? And to be super sessions start. Right? And to be super clear, if we search for setup, you can

clear, if we search for setup, you can clear, if we search for setup, you can see that this is a brand new script. And see that this is a brand new script. And see that this is a brand new script. And you know, the cloud code team says it you know, the cloud code team says it

you know, the cloud code team says it themselves. Run this to set up and themselves. Run this to set up and themselves. Run this to set up and maintain the code base. All right, use maintain the code base. All right, use maintain the code base. All right, use this for operations you do not want to

this for operations you do not want to this for operations you do not want to run on every session like installing run on every session like installing run on every session like installing dependencies, running migrations, or dependencies, running migrations, or

dependencies, running migrations, or periodic maintenance tasks. So again, periodic maintenance tasks. So again, periodic maintenance tasks. So again, not super novel, but what we can do with not super novel, but what we can do with not super novel, but what we can do with this is novel. When we combine this with

this is novel. When we combine this with this is novel. When we combine this with a great prompt, some logging, some a great prompt, some logging, some a great prompt, some logging, some documentation, we can initialize and documentation, we can initialize and

documentation, we can initialize and then install and have an agent run to then install and have an agent run to then install and have an agent run to validate this workflow. We can run a validate this workflow. We can run a validate this workflow. We can run a command that does our installation for

command that does our installation for command that does our installation for us when we have that new engineer on our us when we have that new engineer on our us when we have that new engineer on our team, that new hire. We can get them team, that new hire. We can get them

team, that new hire. We can get them quickly set up or we can set up our quickly set up or we can set up our quickly set up or we can set up our codebase on other machines. Hint hint, codebase on other machines. Hint hint, codebase on other machines. Hint hint, agent sandboxes, and they can just

agent sandboxes, and they can just agent sandboxes, and they can just quickly set things up right from this quickly set things up right from this quickly set things up right from this just file. So, let's go ahead and see just file. So, let's go ahead and see

just file. So, let's go ahead and see what it looks like to combine scripts what it looks like to combine scripts what it looks like to combine scripts with agents just to see all of our options. Once just to see all of our options. Once again, just cli. And you can see exactly

[6:14]

again, just cli. And you can see exactly again, just cli. And you can see exactly what this is going to run. The same what this is going to run. The same what this is going to run. The same command with a prompt that's going to command with a prompt that's going to

command with a prompt that's going to immediately kick off. So, let's fire immediately kick off. So, let's fire immediately kick off. So, let's fire this. And you can see here our install this. And you can see here our install this. And you can see here our install command is running right away. The first

command is running right away. The first command is running right away. The first thing it does is it's running that thing it does is it's running that thing it does is it's running that /prime command. You can think of this /prime command. You can think of this

/prime command. You can think of this like our claw.md file except it's like our claw.md file except it's like our claw.md file except it's dynamic. You can point it to whatever dynamic. You can point it to whatever dynamic. You can point it to whatever you want and you can run it whenever you

you want and you can run it whenever you you want and you can run it whenever you want. It's pulling in documentation. want. It's pulling in documentation.

want. It's pulling in documentation. It's understanding the codebase and then It's understanding the codebase and then It's understanding the codebase and then it will run installation validation.

it will run installation validation. it will run installation validation. It's running the usual report for our It's running the usual report for our It's running the usual report for our prime command, telling us how the prime command, telling us how the

prime command, telling us how the codebase works. When we're priming, codebase works. When we're priming, codebase works. When we're priming, we're getting our agent up and running we're getting our agent up and running we're getting our agent up and running on the basics of the codebase. But now,

on the basics of the codebase. But now, on the basics of the codebase. But now, this agent is continuing to install. So, this agent is continuing to install. So, this agent is continuing to install. So, you can see the initialize hook ran and you can see the initialize hook ran and

you can see the initialize hook ran and now it's going to get the most recent now it's going to get the most recent now it's going to get the most recent results and report them to us. So, we're results and report them to us. So, we're results and report them to us. So, we're building an agent on top of our

building an agent on top of our building an agent on top of our deterministic installation process. You deterministic installation process. You deterministic installation process. You know, keep note, we still ran a nit know, keep note, we still ran a nit

know, keep note, we still ran a nit there. So before our /prime command ran there. So before our /prime command ran there. So before our /prime command ran and kicked off the user prompt sububmit and kicked off the user prompt sububmit and kicked off the user prompt sububmit hook, we ran that setup command. We can

hook, we ran that setup command. We can hook, we ran that setup command. We can then thanks to our logging and then thanks to our logging and then thanks to our logging and setup.nit, our agent can read that out setup.nit, our agent can read that out

setup.nit, our agent can read that out and report on it. All right, so it and report on it. All right, so it and report on it. All right, so it actually created documentation for us on actually created documentation for us on actually created documentation for us on installation. So we have install results

installation. So we have install results installation. So we have install results here and you can see it's reported it to here and you can see it's reported it to here and you can see it's reported it to us. We don't even need to go that deep us. We don't even need to go that deep

us. We don't even need to go that deep though because it just gave us that though because it just gave us that though because it just gave us that response right here. So if we open this response right here. So if we open this response right here. So if we open this up, you can see it wrote that doc and it

up, you can see it wrote that doc and it up, you can see it wrote that doc and it gave us the install success. Now this is gave us the install success. Now this is gave us the install success. Now this is a simple again demo example. A lot of a simple again demo example. A lot of

a simple again demo example. A lot of what I do here on the channel every what I do here on the channel every what I do here on the channel every single week is I try to give you the single week is I try to give you the single week is I try to give you the idea you can embed into your work into

idea you can embed into your work into idea you can embed into your work into your codebase. But you can see here we your codebase. But you can see here we your codebase. But you can see here we have a great report. Now what if have a great report. Now what if

have a great report. Now what if something went wrong? This is where we something went wrong? This is where we something went wrong? This is where we would add common workflow resolution would add common workflow resolution would add common workflow resolution steps so that your installation prompt

steps so that your installation prompt steps so that your installation prompt does the job you would have to do when does the job you would have to do when does the job you would have to do when you're setting up new engineers on your you're setting up new engineers on your

you're setting up new engineers on your team. when you're cloning your repo and team. when you're cloning your repo and team. when you're cloning your repo and setting up new agent sandboxes. This setting up new agent sandboxes. This setting up new agent sandboxes. This command is going to be very very

command is going to be very very command is going to be very very important for spinning up and setting up important for spinning up and setting up important for spinning up and setting up your new code bases. And so this is our your new code bases. And so this is our

your new code bases. And so this is our /install command. So we've combined /install command. So we've combined /install command. So we've combined terminism, some logging, and our agentic terminism, some logging, and our agentic terminism, some logging, and our agentic prompt to set up our codebase in an

prompt to set up our codebase in an prompt to set up our codebase in an interactive way. This is a new pattern interactive way. This is a new pattern interactive way. This is a new pattern that I'm going to be deploying in every that I'm going to be deploying in every

that I'm going to be deploying in every single one of my codebases moving single one of my codebases moving single one of my codebases moving forward. Why not standardize your forward. Why not standardize your forward. Why not standardize your installation process? And we can, of

[8:17]

installation process? And we can, of installation process? And we can, of course, open up this install prompt. you course, open up this install prompt. you course, open up this install prompt. you know exactly where this is.cloud know exactly where this is.cloud

know exactly where this is.cloud commands/install commands/install commands/install and we can see the following workflow.

and we can see the following workflow. and we can see the following workflow. As always, we have our standard agentic As always, we have our standard agentic As always, we have our standard agentic prompt format with only the sections prompt format with only the sections

prompt format with only the sections that we need to ship this. We'll get to that we need to ship this. We'll get to that we need to ship this. We'll get to our human in the loop mode variable here our human in the loop mode variable here our human in the loop mode variable here in a second. But you can see this is a

in a second. But you can see this is a in a second. But you can see this is a very simple workflow. We're running our very simple workflow. We're running our very simple workflow. We're running our /prime. We're checking if we're in /prime. We're checking if we're in

/prime. We're checking if we're in interactive mode, which we'll get to in interactive mode, which we'll get to in interactive mode, which we'll get to in just a second. We read the log file. We just a second. We read the log file. We just a second. We read the log file. We write the results and then report what's

write the results and then report what's write the results and then report what's going on to the user. All right. And going on to the user. All right. And going on to the user. All right. And then from here you could add a lot more then from here you could add a lot more

then from here you could add a lot more detail on how to resolve any issues that detail on how to resolve any issues that detail on how to resolve any issues that come up if you have common issues that come up if you have common issues that come up if you have common issues that reoccur during the installation process.

reoccur during the installation process. reoccur during the installation process. Otherwise you can just have a Otherwise you can just have a Otherwise you can just have a conversation with your agent and discuss conversation with your agent and discuss

conversation with your agent and discuss how to resolve the specific failures. So how to resolve the specific failures. So how to resolve the specific failures. So that's the install command. Now this is that's the install command. Now this is that's the install command. Now this is where things get interesting. We've now

where things get interesting. We've now where things get interesting. We've now combined agents with the existing combined agents with the existing combined agents with the existing scripts with the logging. We can now do scripts with the logging. We can now do

scripts with the logging. We can now do something powerful like this. So as normal, we'll run the just command So as normal, we'll run the just command so we can see the available options to so we can see the available options to so we can see the available options to us in this codebase. I find myself using

us in this codebase. I find myself using us in this codebase. I find myself using this just file over and over now to this just file over and over now to this just file over and over now to standardize certain workflows, certain standardize certain workflows, certain

standardize certain workflows, certain agents, and certain ways to launching agents, and certain ways to launching agents, and certain ways to launching into engineering inside of a specific into engineering inside of a specific into engineering inside of a specific codebase. I really do think about the

codebase. I really do think about the codebase. I really do think about the just file as a launchpad for all the just file as a launchpad for all the just file as a launchpad for all the commands that you and your team will run commands that you and your team will run

commands that you and your team will run and your agents will run throughout your and your agents will run throughout your and your agents will run throughout your developer work. We're going to run a developer work. We're going to run a developer work. We're going to run a very very powerful command that I think

very very powerful command that I think very very powerful command that I think will represent the future of how every will represent the future of how every will represent the future of how every codebase will get set up. We're going to codebase will get set up. We're going to

codebase will get set up. We're going to run So we'll type just and run So we'll type just and run So we'll type just and we'll kick this command off and it's we'll kick this command off and it's we'll kick this command off and it's going to do something pretty incredible

going to do something pretty incredible going to do something pretty incredible here. Not only will we kick off the here. Not only will we kick off the here. Not only will we kick off the codebase as normal, it's going to prime codebase as normal, it's going to prime

codebase as normal, it's going to prime itself, get itself set up, understand itself, get itself set up, understand itself, get itself set up, understand where everything is much faster than you where everything is much faster than you where everything is much faster than you or I could ever set up a new codebase

or I could ever set up a new codebase or I could ever set up a new codebase and truly understand it end to end. And and truly understand it end to end. And and truly understand it end to end. And then we're going to run our human in the then we're going to run our human in the

then we're going to run our human in the loop version of this prompt. In fact, loop version of this prompt. In fact, loop version of this prompt. In fact, it's just a branching point off from our it's just a branching point off from our it's just a branching point off from our existing prompt. You can see our agent

existing prompt. You can see our agent existing prompt. You can see our agent recognizes since the mode argument is recognizes since the mode argument is recognizes since the mode argument is true, I need to run interactive true, I need to run interactive

true, I need to run interactive installation. And now we're going to installation. And now we're going to installation. And now we're going to work back and forth with our agent, work back and forth with our agent, work back and forth with our agent, answer a few questions on how we want

[10:20]

answer a few questions on how we want answer a few questions on how we want things to get set up. This is very, very things to get set up. This is very, very things to get set up. This is very, very powerful for onboarding new engineers.

powerful for onboarding new engineers. powerful for onboarding new engineers. So the first question here is how should So the first question here is how should So the first question here is how should I handle the database? We'll say fresh I handle the database? We'll say fresh

I handle the database? We'll say fresh database. What installation mode? Full, database. What installation mode? Full, database. What installation mode? Full, minimal, skip, we'll do full. Should I minimal, skip, we'll do full. Should I minimal, skip, we'll do full. Should I check your environment variables? Let's

check your environment variables? Let's check your environment variables? Let's do it. How would you like to set these do it. How would you like to set these do it. How would you like to set these up? Let's get the guided experience. And up? Let's get the guided experience. And

up? Let's get the guided experience. And then we can submit these questions. I then we can submit these questions. I then we can submit these questions. I think Cloud Code only supports four think Cloud Code only supports four think Cloud Code only supports four questions at a time. So that's why it's

questions at a time. So that's why it's questions at a time. So that's why it's doing this. There we go. So we're now doing this. There we go. So we're now doing this. There we go. So we're now running the workflow. And you can see running the workflow. And you can see

running the workflow. And you can see our agent is doing some preliminary our agent is doing some preliminary our agent is doing some preliminary tests. We want to see if we have Python, tests. We want to see if we have Python, tests. We want to see if we have Python, Node, UV, blah blah blah. And then it's

Node, UV, blah blah blah. And then it's Node, UV, blah blah blah. And then it's just going to run the installation as it just going to run the installation as it just going to run the installation as it did before, right? But now we have this did before, right? But now we have this

did before, right? But now we have this back and forth human in the loop process back and forth human in the loop process back and forth human in the loop process where we can set things up together. All where we can set things up together. All where we can set things up together. All right. So there it is initializing the

right. So there it is initializing the right. So there it is initializing the database. Now it's going to configure database. Now it's going to configure database. Now it's going to configure our environment variables. So these are our environment variables. So these are

our environment variables. So these are just things that you need to do all the just things that you need to do all the just things that you need to do all the time with your agents. You can see here time with your agents. You can see here time with your agents. You can see here uh I have the environment variable

uh I have the environment variable uh I have the environment variable blocked. So this agent is not going to blocked. So this agent is not going to blocked. So this agent is not going to be able to touch this. So now it's just be able to touch this. So now it's just

be able to touch this. So now it's just going to directly ask me have I set up going to directly ask me have I set up going to directly ask me have I set up the environment file? And this all might the environment file? And this all might the environment file? And this all might seem like a small thing that you could

seem like a small thing that you could seem like a small thing that you could just set up in the readme. But why do just set up in the readme. But why do just set up in the readme. But why do this by hand anymore? you know, we're this by hand anymore? you know, we're

this by hand anymore? you know, we're adding to the pile of things that our adding to the pile of things that our adding to the pile of things that our agents can do that we don't have to do agents can do that we don't have to do agents can do that we don't have to do anymore. Write that configuration

anymore. Write that configuration anymore. Write that configuration prompt, write that maintenance prompt, prompt, write that maintenance prompt, prompt, write that maintenance prompt, and then walk through it with your and then walk through it with your

and then walk through it with your agents, right? Make that onboarding agents, right? Make that onboarding agents, right? Make that onboarding process for your codebase ultra smooth.

process for your codebase ultra smooth. process for your codebase ultra smooth. I'll just say that I've copied and I'll just say that I've copied and I'll just say that I've copied and configured this. There's actually configured this. There's actually

configured this. There's actually nothing we need to configure for this nothing we need to configure for this nothing we need to configure for this codebase in particular. You can see we codebase in particular. You can see we codebase in particular. You can see we have some example uh files there. I'll

have some example uh files there. I'll have some example uh files there. I'll just say that I have done this. And then just say that I have done this. And then just say that I have done this. And then our agent will just continue the our agent will just continue the

our agent will just continue the workflow. And so we're going down the workflow. And so we're going down the workflow. And so we're going down the step, right? This process that you would step, right? This process that you would step, right? This process that you would normally run with another engineer,

normally run with another engineer, normally run with another engineer, right? you would need to pair program or right? you would need to pair program or right? you would need to pair program or you would be the one pair programming.

you would be the one pair programming. you would be the one pair programming. We now are running into another step. We We now are running into another step. We We now are running into another step. We need to pull in some documentation for need to pull in some documentation for

need to pull in some documentation for our agents. And as things get more our agents. And as things get more our agents. And as things get more agentic, this is going to be important.

agentic, this is going to be important. agentic, this is going to be important. What context you need to pull in from What context you need to pull in from What context you need to pull in from your services, from your third party your services, from your third party

your services, from your third party applications, from your ticket applications, from your ticket applications, from your ticket management systems, for your database.

management systems, for your database. management systems, for your database. This could be anything. We could be This could be anything. We could be This could be anything. We could be walking through configuration steps for walking through configuration steps for

walking through configuration steps for AWS or the Google Cloud CLI. We really AWS or the Google Cloud CLI. We really AWS or the Google Cloud CLI. We really are just working through common are just working through common are just working through common developer workflows with our agents to

[12:25]

developer workflows with our agents to developer workflows with our agents to get things set up more quickly and very get things set up more quickly and very get things set up more quickly and very importantly to standardize this process.

importantly to standardize this process. importantly to standardize this process. Right? If we look at the install.md, you Right? If we look at the install.md, you Right? If we look at the install.md, you can see here we're running prime, but can see here we're running prime, but

can see here we're running prime, but then we're running this second command. then we're running this second command. then we're running this second command. Check for interactive mode. If yes, kick Check for interactive mode. If yes, kick Check for interactive mode. If yes, kick it off and ignore the rest of this

it off and ignore the rest of this it off and ignore the rest of this prompt. So what happens there, right, prompt. So what happens there, right, prompt. So what happens there, right, install-hill. You can see here we have a install-hill. You can see here we have a

install-hill. You can see here we have a great classic agentic prompt, but inside great classic agentic prompt, but inside great classic agentic prompt, but inside of the workflow, we have several of the workflow, we have several of the workflow, we have several questions to ask the user. And that's

questions to ask the user. And that's questions to ask the user. And that's exactly what we're working through right exactly what we're working through right exactly what we're working through right now, right? So go ahead. I'll say fetch now, right? So go ahead. I'll say fetch

now, right? So go ahead. I'll say fetch all docs. It's going to pull in outside all docs. It's going to pull in outside all docs. It's going to pull in outside resources that it should have access to resources that it should have access to resources that it should have access to cuz it has the environment variable set

cuz it has the environment variable set cuz it has the environment variable set up now. And we're going to do some up now. And we're going to do some up now. And we're going to do some documentation scraping based on some documentation scraping based on some

documentation scraping based on some information in the prompt. So not only information in the prompt. So not only information in the prompt. So not only is this great for the new engineer, but is this great for the new engineer, but is this great for the new engineer, but it's great for the onboarding engineer,

it's great for the onboarding engineer, it's great for the onboarding engineer, right? The lead engineer, the you know, right? The lead engineer, the you know, right? The lead engineer, the you know, your your co-worker. Setting this stuff your your co-worker. Setting this stuff

your your co-worker. Setting this stuff up is quite annoying and it's easy to up is quite annoying and it's easy to up is quite annoying and it's easy to forget forget forget all the different things it takes to set

all the different things it takes to set all the different things it takes to set up a new codebase. This is why it's so up a new codebase. This is why it's so up a new codebase. This is why it's so powerful to in natural language just powerful to in natural language just

powerful to in natural language just prompt engineer a endto-end setup prompt engineer a endto-end setup prompt engineer a endto-end setup process for your codebase. And now when process for your codebase. And now when process for your codebase. And now when you have to update something, you don't

you have to update something, you don't you have to update something, you don't look at the docs. You look at the look at the docs. You look at the look at the docs. You look at the script, the initial setup script, and script, the initial setup script, and

script, the initial setup script, and you look at this prompt right here, you look at this prompt right here, you look at this prompt right here, right? Install human in the loop. You right? Install human in the loop. You right? Install human in the loop. You can set up a great interactive workflow

can set up a great interactive workflow can set up a great interactive workflow like this or just an end-to-end oneshot like this or just an end-to-end oneshot like this or just an end-to-end oneshot workflow where your agent then reports workflow where your agent then reports

workflow where your agent then reports everything that went right or wrong. And everything that went right or wrong. And everything that went right or wrong. And so you can see here we have a so you can see here we have a so you can see here we have a documentation scraping step. Our agent

documentation scraping step. Our agent documentation scraping step. Our agent pulled that in, wrote some new pulled that in, wrote some new pulled that in, wrote some new documentation, did a little update in documentation, did a little update in

documentation, did a little update in interactive mode here. Looks like I just interactive mode here. Looks like I just interactive mode here. Looks like I just ran that before. And then it's once ran that before. And then it's once ran that before. And then it's once again giving us a great installation

again giving us a great installation again giving us a great installation summary. So again, you can just really summary. So again, you can just really summary. So again, you can just really really nail in the process of setting up really nail in the process of setting up

really nail in the process of setting up your codebase in an interactive way with your codebase in an interactive way with your codebase in an interactive way with the human in the loop, answering the human in the loop, answering the human in the loop, answering questions, going back and forth, making

questions, going back and forth, making questions, going back and forth, making sure that things are set up properly. A sure that things are set up properly. A sure that things are set up properly. A cool thing you can do as well is add cool thing you can do as well is add

cool thing you can do as well is add some verification steps so that once a some verification steps so that once a some verification steps so that once a step completes, the agent actually goes step completes, the agent actually goes step completes, the agent actually goes off and verifies that you know that

off and verifies that you know that off and verifies that you know that file, that variable, that asset is in file, that variable, that asset is in file, that variable, that asset is in the right place for the codebase to run.

[14:25]

the right place for the codebase to run. the right place for the codebase to run. And you can run oneshot fully agentic And you can run oneshot fully agentic And you can run oneshot fully agentic installation commands that just sets installation commands that just sets

installation commands that just sets everything up in a very opinionated way. everything up in a very opinionated way. everything up in a very opinionated way. In our case here, it's very simple.

In our case here, it's very simple. In our case here, it's very simple. We're just running that standard init We're just running that standard init We're just running that standard init script that the cloud code setup hook script that the cloud code setup hook

script that the cloud code setup hook kicked off for us. All right, so this is kicked off for us. All right, so this is kicked off for us. All right, so this is all fantastic. I think this is really all fantastic. I think this is really all fantastic. I think this is really going to be the future of how code bases

going to be the future of how code bases going to be the future of how code bases are set up and managed because it is the are set up and managed because it is the are set up and managed because it is the agentic way that properly balances agentic way that properly balances

agentic way that properly balances determinism thanks to cloud code hooks determinism thanks to cloud code hooks determinism thanks to cloud code hooks and thanks to great prompt engineering.

and thanks to great prompt engineering. and thanks to great prompt engineering. But we can push this even further, But we can push this even further, But we can push this even further, right? It's not just about installing right? It's not just about installing

right? It's not just about installing new code bases because oftent times new code bases because oftent times new code bases because oftent times there's going to be configuration and there's going to be configuration and there's going to be configuration and maintenance work that needs to happen on

maintenance work that needs to happen on maintenance work that needs to happen on a day-to-day week-toeek basis. And a day-to-day week-toeek basis. And a day-to-day week-toeek basis. And that's what brings us to the maintenance that's what brings us to the maintenance

that's what brings us to the maintenance problem. We now have a command runner, right? A We now have a command runner, right? A minimalist command runner for minimalist command runner for minimalist command runner for standardizing all the different ways we

standardizing all the different ways we standardizing all the different ways we run agents and developer tools in this run agents and developer tools in this run agents and developer tools in this codebase. And we can of course run just codebase. And we can of course run just

codebase. And we can of course run just clmm. clmm. clmm. So this is a gentic codebase So this is a gentic codebase So this is a gentic codebase maintenance. Now this is a simple mock

maintenance. Now this is a simple mock maintenance. Now this is a simple mock testing application that I have here. We testing application that I have here. We testing application that I have here. We have a back end and a front end. I think have a back end and a front end. I think

have a back end and a front end. I think this is just going to pretend to run a this is just going to pretend to run a this is just going to pretend to run a migration on our in-memory SQL light migration on our in-memory SQL light migration on our in-memory SQL light database. But the idea is just that if

database. But the idea is just that if database. But the idea is just that if there are any assets, if there's any there are any assets, if there's any there are any assets, if there's any maintenance, if there's any codebase maintenance, if there's any codebase

maintenance, if there's any codebase cleanup, if you want to do security cleanup, if you want to do security cleanup, if you want to do security checks in your codebase to make sure checks in your codebase to make sure checks in your codebase to make sure that nothing has gotten leaked or to

that nothing has gotten leaked or to that nothing has gotten leaked or to make sure that there's no dead code or make sure that there's no dead code or make sure that there's no dead code or dead code branches, the maintenance hook dead code branches, the maintenance hook

dead code branches, the maintenance hook is a great one to run. And the hook is a great one to run. And the hook is a great one to run. And the hook itself is fine. Engineers running itself is fine. Engineers running itself is fine. Engineers running production code bases, you already have

production code bases, you already have production code bases, you already have maintenance scripts. They're probably maintenance scripts. They're probably maintenance scripts. They're probably just a lot more scattered than an just a lot more scattered than an

just a lot more scattered than an approach like this. The great part about approach like this. The great part about approach like this. The great part about this is that once that deterministic this is that once that deterministic this is that once that deterministic hook runs, we now have a prompt that

hook runs, we now have a prompt that hook runs, we now have a prompt that follows it up, validates it, and if it follows it up, validates it, and if it follows it up, validates it, and if it wants to, it can run its own maintenance wants to, it can run its own maintenance

wants to, it can run its own maintenance additions to it as well. So I think additions to it as well. So I think additions to it as well. So I think relying on the the maintenance scripts relying on the the maintenance scripts relying on the the maintenance scripts alone and the setup scripts alone I

alone and the setup scripts alone I alone and the setup scripts alone I don't think it's actually that don't think it's actually that don't think it's actually that interesting novel useful at all because interesting novel useful at all because

interesting novel useful at all because we can already do this right. What is we can already do this right. What is we can already do this right. What is powerful is when you combine it with an powerful is when you combine it with an powerful is when you combine it with an agentic prompt that you can interact

[16:28]

agentic prompt that you can interact agentic prompt that you can interact with or with an agentic prompt that is with or with an agentic prompt that is with or with an agentic prompt that is intelligent enough to work through the intelligent enough to work through the

intelligent enough to work through the kind of second and third order issues kind of second and third order issues kind of second and third order issues that might arise when you're setting up that might arise when you're setting up that might arise when you're setting up a new codebase. And when they do arise,

a new codebase. And when they do arise, a new codebase. And when they do arise, you can recode it back into the prompt, you can recode it back into the prompt, you can recode it back into the prompt, right? You can add the common problems right? You can add the common problems

right? You can add the common problems inside of the workflow. For instance, inside of the workflow. For instance, inside of the workflow. For instance, you could do something like this. You you could do something like this. You you could do something like this. You could say common issues. The database is

could say common issues. The database is could say common issues. The database is corrupt. Clear the database and rerun. corrupt. Clear the database and rerun.

corrupt. Clear the database and rerun. And just to be super clear here, right? And just to be super clear here, right? And just to be super clear here, right? You would set up this section by saying You would set up this section by saying You would set up this section by saying something like this. If you encounter

something like this. If you encounter something like this. If you encounter exactly any of the following issues, exactly any of the following issues, exactly any of the following issues, follow the steps to resolve them. And so follow the steps to resolve them. And so

follow the steps to resolve them. And so the pattern here is simpler. Database the pattern here is simpler. Database the pattern here is simpler. Database corruption and then solution. So you corruption and then solution. So you corruption and then solution. So you might organize this language here like

might organize this language here like might organize this language here like this. You might say problem and then you this. You might say problem and then you this. You might say problem and then you could say solution. And then you can could say solution. And then you can

could say solution. And then you can just kind of repeat this pattern. If you just kind of repeat this pattern. If you just kind of repeat this pattern. If you want, you could encode this into, you want, you could encode this into, you want, you could encode this into, you know, YAML block here. It doesn't really

know, YAML block here. It doesn't really know, YAML block here. It doesn't really matter. Agents are going to be able to matter. Agents are going to be able to matter. Agents are going to be able to read whatever you put here. But that's a read whatever you put here. But that's a

read whatever you put here. But that's a way that you can set up maintenance and way that you can set up maintenance and way that you can set up maintenance and installation prompts that are installation prompts that are installation prompts that are intelligent and that have embedded the

intelligent and that have embedded the intelligent and that have embedded the common workflows of your code bases common workflows of your code bases common workflows of your code bases installation and maintenance. None of installation and maintenance. None of

installation and maintenance. None of this is really rocket science, this is really rocket science, this is really rocket science, especially if you've been with the especially if you've been with the especially if you've been with the channel for a while. You know that we're

channel for a while. You know that we're channel for a while. You know that we're using prompts for everything now. And using prompts for everything now. And using prompts for everything now. And we're setting up these reusable we're setting up these reusable

we're setting up these reusable workflows that we can deploy one or more workflows that we can deploy one or more workflows that we can deploy one or more agents to solve problems agentically for agents to solve problems agentically for agents to solve problems agentically for us. But I really wanted to capture this

us. But I really wanted to capture this us. But I really wanted to capture this idea in a single self-contained video idea in a single self-contained video idea in a single self-contained video because it combined a couple of key because it combined a couple of key

because it combined a couple of key things that are going to be reoccurring things that are going to be reoccurring things that are going to be reoccurring themes on the channel throughout the themes on the channel throughout the themes on the channel throughout the entire year. Our theme for this year in

entire year. Our theme for this year in entire year. Our theme for this year in 2026 is to increase the trust we have in 2026 is to increase the trust we have in 2026 is to increase the trust we have in our agents. That means being able to our agents. That means being able to

our agents. That means being able to quickly operate customized solutions quickly operate customized solutions quickly operate customized solutions that combine the old world of that combine the old world of that combine the old world of engineering with the new world of

engineering with the new world of engineering with the new world of agents. We're talking about agents. We're talking about agents. We're talking about deterministic code and agentics, right?

deterministic code and agentics, right? deterministic code and agentics, right? Prompts, skills, sub aents, multi- aent Prompts, skills, sub aents, multi- aent Prompts, skills, sub aents, multi- aent orchestration, all of it. With just orchestration, all of it. With just

orchestration, all of it. With just files, we now have a simple file that we files, we now have a simple file that we files, we now have a simple file that we can use to embed repeat prompts, repeat can use to embed repeat prompts, repeat can use to embed repeat prompts, repeat agents, and repeat workflows. The just

agents, and repeat workflows. The just agents, and repeat workflows. The just files really do help put together the files really do help put together the files really do help put together the install and maintain workflows, but also install and maintain workflows, but also

[18:32]

install and maintain workflows, but also this is a powerful tool for running this is a powerful tool for running this is a powerful tool for running agents in many many configurations and agents in many many configurations and agents in many many configurations and workflows. Right? All you need to do now

workflows. Right? All you need to do now workflows. Right? All you need to do now is come into your codebase, run just and is come into your codebase, run just and is come into your codebase, run just and just see what's available. I highly just see what's available. I highly

just see what's available. I highly recommend you check out this tool. It's recommend you check out this tool. It's recommend you check out this tool. It's very powerful. But what this offers us very powerful. But what this offers us very powerful. But what this offers us when you combine it with prompts and

when you combine it with prompts and when you combine it with prompts and scripts coming right from the cloud code scripts coming right from the cloud code scripts coming right from the cloud code brand new setup hook is a standardized brand new setup hook is a standardized

brand new setup hook is a standardized way to install and maintain your code way to install and maintain your code bases over time as they grow. Then you bases over time as they grow. Then you bases over time as they grow. Then you can push that even further. Just running can push that even further. Just running

can push that even further. Just running scripts is probably not going to cut it scripts is probably not going to cut it scripts is probably not going to cut it once your codebase gets more complex.

once your codebase gets more complex. once your codebase gets more complex. You're going to want to add intelligence You're going to want to add intelligence You're going to want to add intelligence to that. We can quickly just copy and to that. We can quickly just copy and

to that. We can quickly just copy and paste this command and build a dedicated paste this command and build a dedicated paste this command and build a dedicated prompt to do just that. We have an prompt to do just that. We have an prompt to do just that. We have an install command. This is a pattern

install command. This is a pattern install command. This is a pattern that's gaining popularity. I'm not the that's gaining popularity. I'm not the that's gaining popularity. I'm not the only one that's seen this and that's only one that's seen this and that's

only one that's seen this and that's using this pattern. I think the just using this pattern. I think the just using this pattern. I think the just file is a new addition here, but if we file is a new addition here, but if we file is a new addition here, but if we open up this blog here by Mintfi, you

open up this blog here by Mintfi, you open up this blog here by Mintfi, you can see they have pitched this exact can see they have pitched this exact can see they have pitched this exact same idea very recently, January 15th, a same idea very recently, January 15th, a

same idea very recently, January 15th, a standard for LM executables. They're standard for LM executables. They're standard for LM executables. They're trying to build a standard for this. I trying to build a standard for this. I trying to build a standard for this. I don't think we really need a standard.

don't think we really need a standard. don't think we really need a standard. It's just the idea that matters, right? It's just the idea that matters, right?

It's just the idea that matters, right? Slashinstall slashs setup, whatever you Slashinstall slashs setup, whatever you Slashinstall slashs setup, whatever you want to call it, however you want to want to call it, however you want to want to call it, however you want to organize this. It's just a great way to

organize this. It's just a great way to organize this. It's just a great way to agentically set up and install and agentically set up and install and agentically set up and install and operate the installation process. This operate the installation process. This

operate the installation process. This is one of those use cases, one of those is one of those use cases, one of those is one of those use cases, one of those categories of very very clear return on categories of very very clear return on categories of very very clear return on investment. Think about the time it

investment. Think about the time it investment. Think about the time it takes you to onboard a new engineer. Now takes you to onboard a new engineer. Now takes you to onboard a new engineer. Now think about how fast you want your team think about how fast you want your team

think about how fast you want your team to grow. Then ask yourself, can we just to grow. Then ask yourself, can we just to grow. Then ask yourself, can we just build a prompt? Can we basically build a build a prompt? Can we basically build a build a prompt? Can we basically build a specialized agent that can run the setup

specialized agent that can run the setup specialized agent that can run the setup and installation process and the and installation process and the and installation process and the maintenance process? And if you want to, maintenance process? And if you want to,

maintenance process? And if you want to, you can even make it interactive to make you can even make it interactive to make you can even make it interactive to make every single step super clear. And the every single step super clear. And the every single step super clear. And the answer to that question is you

answer to that question is you answer to that question is you absolutely can. Agents are good enough. absolutely can. Agents are good enough.

absolutely can. Agents are good enough. You are good enough. If you've been You are good enough. If you've been You are good enough. If you've been watching this channel, you know, for any watching this channel, you know, for any watching this channel, you know, for any amount of time really, you've seen these

amount of time really, you've seen these amount of time really, you've seen these powerful patterns that we're building powerful patterns that we're building powerful patterns that we're building now, these powerful agentic workflows in now, these powerful agentic workflows in

now, these powerful agentic workflows in our agentics, right? In our prompts, our agentics, right? In our prompts, our agentics, right? In our prompts, custom slash commands, sub aents, our custom slash commands, sub aents, our custom slash commands, sub aents, our skills. It's all available here. There

[20:35]

skills. It's all available here. There skills. It's all available here. There has never been more opportunity and has never been more opportunity and has never been more opportunity and there's never been more ways to truly there's never been more ways to truly

there's never been more ways to truly augment and automate your developer life augment and automate your developer life augment and automate your developer life cycles in your codebase. But you have to cycles in your codebase. But you have to cycles in your codebase. But you have to standardize it. You have to make it

standardize it. You have to make it standardize it. You have to make it consistent. And so that's why I think consistent. And so that's why I think consistent. And so that's why I think the prompt, the hooks, the just files, the prompt, the hooks, the just files,

the prompt, the hooks, the just files, it was worth bringing together here for it was worth bringing together here for it was worth bringing together here for you so that you can understand how to you so that you can understand how to you so that you can understand how to repeatedly solve these problems with a

repeatedly solve these problems with a repeatedly solve these problems with a consistent pattern. Check out this consistent pattern. Check out this consistent pattern. Check out this install maintain codebase. I built this install maintain codebase. I built this

install maintain codebase. I built this to give you a quick start on this to give you a quick start on this to give you a quick start on this pattern. I'll also link of course the pattern. I'll also link of course the pattern. I'll also link of course the cloud code documentation and I'll link

cloud code documentation and I'll link cloud code documentation and I'll link this just command runner. This thing is this just command runner. This thing is this just command runner. This thing is super awesome because it's so simple. Uh super awesome because it's so simple. Uh

super awesome because it's so simple. Uh there are a lot more features in here we there are a lot more features in here we there are a lot more features in here we didn't discuss. I'll be talking about didn't discuss. I'll be talking about didn't discuss. I'll be talking about this tool on the channel more in the

this tool on the channel more in the this tool on the channel more in the future because it really allows us to future because it really allows us to future because it really allows us to set up powerful inloop customized agents set up powerful inloop customized agents

set up powerful inloop customized agents that do one thing and do it that do one thing and do it that do one thing and do it extraordinarily well. I think if you're extraordinarily well. I think if you're extraordinarily well. I think if you're an engineering lead or you're involved

an engineering lead or you're involved an engineering lead or you're involved with hiring engineers on your team, with hiring engineers on your team, with hiring engineers on your team, often these tools combined solves real often these tools combined solves real

often these tools combined solves real problems for you very, very well. It's problems for you very, very well. It's problems for you very, very well. It's great for onboarding.

You can even boil these for maintenance. You can even boil these for maintenance. You can even boil these prompts and these workflows into the

prompts and these workflows into the prompts and these workflows into the default of how your engineers run agents default of how your engineers run agents default of how your engineers run agents in their codebase. When you set this up, in their codebase. When you set this up,

in their codebase. When you set this up, you get scheduled health checks. Your you get scheduled health checks. Your you get scheduled health checks. Your codebase is always up to date. It's codebase is always up to date. It's codebase is always up to date. It's always updating vulnerable mpm packages

always updating vulnerable mpm packages always updating vulnerable mpm packages which happens every other day now. And which happens every other day now. And which happens every other day now. And really what you get here with these really what you get here with these

really what you get here with these prompts that help you install and prompts that help you install and prompts that help you install and maintain is a living document that maintain is a living document that maintain is a living document that executes. This is the dream for a lot of

executes. This is the dream for a lot of executes. This is the dream for a lot of engineers. We can now communicate action engineers. We can now communicate action engineers. We can now communicate action in natural language and encode that for in natural language and encode that for
