[00:00] Most people treat Chad GPT like a new
[00:03] intern, but I use it to drive five
[00:06] strategies. It's like having five of the
[00:09] world's smartest minds work 24/7 for
[00:12] only $20 a month to help me move faster,
[00:16] decide better, and focus on what truly
[00:18] matters. But I only figured this out
[00:21] after spending years in tech and AI as a
[00:24] CEO, board member, and investor, where I
[00:27] watched elite teams use AI in ways most
[00:30] people never see. So today, I'm sharing
[00:33] those five strategies to use chat PT so
[00:36] well, it feels illegal. The first
[00:39] strategy is called the clone. When I was
[00:42] a kid, my grandpa had late stage
[00:45] Alzheimer's. Every few minutes he would
[00:48] look at my grandmother, the woman he had
[00:50] been married for over 60 years, and he
[00:53] would ask, "Who are you?" And then he
[00:55] would go ahead and tell me a story,
[00:57] forgetting that he just told me the
[00:59] exact same story 5 minutes ago. His
[01:02] brain didn't have memory of his last 5
[01:05] minutes. Chat GPT suffers from something
[01:08] very similar. Every time you open a new
[01:10] chat session, you're starting from zero
[01:13] context. But there is a way to give chat
[01:17] GPT an almost telepathic ability. It can
[01:20] keep the memory and context for you
[01:23] alive without you explaining every
[01:26] single time. For that, I apply a
[01:28] three-step framework called ESP. E is
[01:32] extract. Open the voice mode in Chad GPD
[01:36] and say, "Listen, you're my chief of
[01:39] staff. Interview me for 20 minutes, 30
[01:42] minutes. my background, my tone, my
[01:44] strategy, my blind spots. Then talk a
[01:48] while. Be messy. Don't self-edit. This
[01:52] step is about raw capture only. S is
[01:56] synthesize. Now, this is where you turn
[01:59] the raw data into an operating system.
[02:02] So, upload the transcript of whatever
[02:03] you said to Chat GPT and ask Chat GPT to
[02:07] organize it into a summary on who you
[02:10] are and how you think. Now go to
[02:12] settings, custom instructions, and paste
[02:14] your summary. By the way, this is also
[02:17] the place where you tell Chat GPT
[02:19] exactly how you want it to behave.
[02:21] Always format data as tables. Don't send
[02:25] me walls of text. But now Chat GPT knows
[02:28] who you are, how you want your responses
[02:31] shaped, and what to avoid by default.
[02:34] And here's where it gets really wild. P
[02:38] is for projects. Think of a project as a
[02:41] space where you store your context. It
[02:44] lives with your instructions, memories,
[02:47] files, repeated tasks. For instance, for
[02:50] your work projects, upload your resume,
[02:53] PDFs, and data that's relevant. You can
[02:56] even customize the instructions inside
[02:58] each project's settings. Just remember
[03:01] not to mix domains. So for example, I
[03:04] have my consulting project and then my
[03:07] YouTube project and my health project
[03:10] separate. This turns your EI from a
[03:12] temporary chat into a persistent brain.
[03:16] But that's only the first battle. You
[03:18] still need an army to do the heavy
[03:20] lifting. That is our next strategy. The
[03:23] second strategy is called the swarm.
[03:26] There's a great story in ancient Indian
[03:28] mythology about a demon who was
[03:31] impossible to defeat with a single
[03:33] weapon. So the great goddess manifested
[03:37] eight arms wielding eight different
[03:39] weapons at once. She was known as
[03:42] Ashtabuja Dura. Eight arms, eight
[03:46] weapons, eight battles fought in
[03:48] parallel. And most of us are fighting
[03:51] our own modern demons with just our two
[03:54] bare hands. Our brain can only handle
[03:57] one task at a time. You need to hire
[04:00] three specific advanced capabilities of
[04:03] chat GPT. Number one, your hands. Stop
[04:07] doing tasks one by one. Use the agent
[04:09] mode. Dispatch the swarm. Instead of
[04:12] searching for a single lead, give chat
[04:14] JPT a command. 550 leads in the SAS
[04:18] space. Verify their emails. Rank them by
[04:21] revenue. That's it. Let it run. You go
[04:23] get coffee. But there is one catch. Chat
[04:26] GPT is still trapped inside a text box.
[04:29] It can find leads, but it can't actually
[04:32] put them into your CRM or build a
[04:34] process around them. Number two, your
[04:37] eyes. Stop describing your problems.
[04:40] Chat GPT is very visual. You can take a
[04:43] photo of a whiteboard sketch, a broken
[04:46] car part, or a complex analytics
[04:48] dashboard. Just upload it and then say,
[04:51] "Analyze this picture. Tell me what's
[04:53] wrong with it." and tell me one move
[04:55] that I can make to fix it. You're using
[04:57] chat GPT as your eyes, not just your
[04:59] keyboard. And the great thing is Chat
[05:01] GPT can see things human eyes can't. And
[05:04] finally, number three, your research
[05:06] assistant. You can do deep research that
[05:08] was once the domain of an analyst who
[05:11] you would pay $50,000 for. Recently, I
[05:14] was in a meeting with a chief technology
[05:15] officer of a large firm. And he said
[05:18] something very interesting. He said, "I
[05:20] had to evaluate six presentations
[05:23] delivered by a very large IT consulting
[05:26] firm on the technology infrastructure of
[05:28] a massive data center." And there were
[05:30] 300 pages of dense information. But what
[05:34] did he do? He uploaded them all in Chad
[05:36] GPT, hired a swarm of AI analysts. One
[05:40] afternoon, that's all it took. Now, that
[05:43] would have taken weeks before. That's
[05:46] the world we're heading into. In the age
[05:48] of AI, you won't be billing for your
[05:50] time anymore. You'll only bill for your
[05:53] taste. So, this swarm gives you an army
[05:56] of powerful interns. But your next
[05:59] strategy isn't about hiring AI to take
[06:02] orders. Is there to challenge you? Your
[06:05] third strategy then is the devil's
[06:07] advocate. Around the 1500s, the Catholic
[06:10] Church was the most powerful
[06:13] organization on earth. But it was also
[06:15] under a lot of attack. By 1587, the Pope
[06:19] had a massive problem. The church was
[06:21] canonizing saints left and right. So the
[06:24] Pope did something pretty radical. He
[06:27] created an office called the Advocaci,
[06:31] the devil's advocate. This person's
[06:34] entire job was to argue against the
[06:37] canonization of any saint, to find the
[06:39] dirt, to poke holes, to be ruthless. The
[06:43] church realized this 400 years ago. When
[06:45] the stakes are high, good decisions are
[06:48] rarely made through agreements. They
[06:51] come from conflict. Now, why is this
[06:53] necessary? Well, it's called the IKEA
[06:55] effect. We fall in love with anything we
[06:58] build ourselves. Research shows that
[07:01] smart people are great at spotting flaws
[07:03] in other people's thinking, physically
[07:05] incapable of seeing them in their own.
[07:08] So the key insight, most people use chat
[07:11] GPT for validation, but you should use
[07:15] it for violation. But here's the
[07:18] problem. Chat GPT is programmed to keep
[07:20] you happy. So you have to force it to
[07:22] behave differently. So, here are the
[07:25] three tricks to break the AI's
[07:27] peopleleaser programming. First, use
[07:30] magic triggers. Force adversarial
[07:33] thinking. Instead of saying, "What do
[07:35] you think?" be specific. Prompt it and
[07:37] say, "Audit this using first principles
[07:40] or act as my fierce competitor." You may
[07:43] not get what you want, but you will get
[07:46] what you need. Second, shadow boxing.
[07:49] Don't step into the ring unprepared.
[07:51] Let's say if you're going out to raise
[07:53] money for your venture, tell the AI,
[07:55] simulate a debate between a ruthless,
[07:58] skeptical VC and a visionary product
[08:01] designer. Let the VC push back on the
[08:04] idea. I want to see that fight and learn
[08:07] from it. This way, you let AI expose the
[08:10] weak points so you don't fumble on them
[08:13] in the real world meeting. Third, the
[08:16] blind spot check. feed it your strategy
[08:18] and ask one question based on what you
[08:20] know about me. What are the gaps in my
[08:23] reasoning? When we get successful, we
[08:26] develop two bad habits. We trap
[08:29] ourselves in this bubble of our ego and
[08:33] we surround ourselves with people who
[08:36] just say yes. That's why this strategy
[08:38] is so critical to save you from
[08:40] yourself. But knowing where you're wrong
[08:43] or why you're wrong is not enough. You
[08:45] still have to learn fast about what's
[08:48] right. That's where our next strategy
[08:50] comes in, the neural link. And it breaks
[08:52] the rule most of us grew up believing
[08:55] that mastery takes 10,000 hours. You
[08:58] know, there is a famous story about a
[09:00] physicist Max Plank after he won the
[09:02] Nobel Prize, he went on a tour giving
[09:05] the same speech about quantum mechanics
[09:07] every night. Now, his chauffeur sat in
[09:10] the front row every time and literally
[09:12] memorized every word. One night the
[09:14] chauffeur said, "Professor, I'm getting
[09:16] bored just listening to you. Let's
[09:17] switch. I'll give the lecture on stage
[09:19] and you sit in the audience wearing my
[09:21] cap." Plank of course agreed. Same
[09:24] words, same structure, same cadence. The
[09:28] speech was flawless. But at the end, a
[09:30] physicist in the audience stood up and
[09:33] asked a deep technical question. But the
[09:36] chauffeur didn't panic at all. He smiled
[09:38] and said, "I am surprised to hear such a
[09:41] simple question in a city as advanced as
[09:43] Munich. To prove how simple it is, I'm
[09:46] going to let my chauffeur answer it." Of
[09:48] course, that was Max Plank. But here's
[09:50] the point. Most people use chat like
[09:53] that chauffeur. They copy paste smart
[09:55] sounding phrases and answers to sound
[09:58] intelligent. They have fluency without
[10:00] foundation. So, here are three ways to
[10:02] get that neural link. True understanding
[10:05] without becoming that chauffeur. First
[10:07] the jargon translator for instance tell
[10:10] it explain the concept of API using the
[10:14] restaurant metaphors only. Suddenly the
[10:16] menu becomes the documentation. The
[10:19] kitchen is the server and the waiter is
[10:22] the API. The messenger that takes your
[10:24] order delivers it in the kitchen brings
[10:27] back the results. You aren't learning
[10:29] from scratch. You're translating that
[10:31] jargon into your jargon. Second, the
[10:35] progressive professor Richard Feainman
[10:38] said that if you can't explain it
[10:39] simply, you don't understand it. So
[10:41] don't ask Chachi Peter to explain
[10:44] quantum computing, but instead say
[10:46] explain quantum computing to me three
[10:49] ways. One, like I am a 5-year-old and
[10:52] give me the simplest explanation. Number
[10:54] two, like I am a 15year-old, explain it
[10:57] with logic and examples. And three, like
[11:00] I'm a college student, share the
[11:01] underlying theory. When you do that in
[11:04] that particular order, you will feel any
[11:07] concept click into place in your brain
[11:09] instantly. And third, the degree
[11:12] download. You teach it, you keep it. So
[11:15] use AI to be your target audience or a
[11:18] peer prompted to say something like, I
[11:21] want to build a cool AI commerce
[11:23] product. I need to learn the foundation
[11:25] of how machine learning works. Skip the
[11:27] theory, only give me actionable skills,
[11:29] no fluff, and then test me so I can
[11:32] teach it back to you. You just replaced
[11:34] a boot camp worth $50,000 with a PDF.
[11:38] So, here you are. You have built a
[11:40] high-performance chat GPT machine, but
[11:43] such machines tend to overheat. The
[11:46] fifth strategy is called the executive
[11:48] coach, and without it, none of the other
[11:50] strategies would work. 2,000 years ago,
[11:54] Marcus Orurelius was the emperor of
[11:56] Rome, but he was also the loneliest. He
[11:59] had no one to talk to. So, he hired a
[12:02] coach. That coach was a blank scroll.
[12:06] Every night in his tent, he wrote down
[12:08] his anxieties, his fears, his advice to
[12:12] himself. He titled that manuscript to
[12:15] himself. If you are a successful
[12:17] executive or on the path of being one,
[12:21] you need an executive coach. I had two
[12:24] and they both changed my trajectory
[12:26] dramatically. But sometimes executive
[12:28] coaches and mentors aren't going to be
[12:30] available to you at midnight when you
[12:32] need them the most when you can't sleep
[12:34] because of a decision you have to make.
[12:36] And that's when you can use chat GPT to
[12:39] show you a mirror with zero emotional
[12:42] baggage. You can even turn the voice
[12:44] mode. That's what I do. Here are three
[12:46] tricks to turn chat into your temporary
[12:50] executive coach. First, the vomit
[12:52] mirror. When you are overwhelmed, your
[12:56] brain is going to be a tangled mess. It
[12:59] happens to me. Open voice mode and say,
[13:02] "I am going to rant for 5 minutes about
[13:05] everything stressing me out. Don't
[13:07] interrupt. Just listen. When I'm done,
[13:09] organize my chaos into three lists.
[13:12] Problems I can solve today. problems I
[13:14] need to delegate, noise I need to
[13:16] ignore. That's it. And then go ahead,
[13:20] just rant as long as you want. Second,
[13:23] the stoic mirror. It's possible that you
[13:26] may have just lost a deal or you got
[13:29] fired or something terrible happened.
[13:31] You can say to Chad GPT at that point, I
[13:34] just took a massive loss. I feel like a
[13:36] failure. reframe this situation for me
[13:39] using the story principles and tell me
[13:42] why this is actually an opportunity.
[13:46] Have that conversation until you're
[13:48] convinced. Push back. Let it push back
[13:50] to you. Even if you're not convinced,
[13:53] it'll slow down the emotional spiral
[13:56] that you're on instantly. And the third
[13:58] and the final mirror, the decision
[14:00] mirror. Before you make a massive
[14:02] decision like quitting a job or starting
[14:04] a new company, talk it out. I am about
[14:07] to do X. Here's my logic. Let's have a
[14:09] conversation. You don't have to put
[14:11] faith in Chat GPT's advice. In fact,
[14:14] please don't. But talking it out clears
[14:17] your own head about your own judgment.
[14:20] We covered five strategies and 15 ways
[14:23] to optimize your relationship with Chat
[14:25] GPT. But here's the truth. All of these
[14:28] skills are essentially alpha. In
[14:30] finance, when traders find an edge, they
[14:33] make a fortune and it's called the
[14:35] alpha. But eventually everyone figures
[14:37] it out. What's rare today becomes
[14:40] required tomorrow? That's how life
[14:42] works. And what happens when it all
[14:45] becomes a commodity? How will you
[14:47] maintain your edge then? I'll share my
[14:50] personal story that changed my idea
[14:52] about my edge. A week before I took my
[14:54] CEO job, my executive coach pulled me
[14:57] aside and he said, "Remember, your title
[15:01] is CEO, chief executive officer. But
[15:03] that E does not just stand for
[15:06] executive. It also stands for emotions.
[15:09] You're the chief emotions officer now as
[15:12] well. You have to manage the emotions of
[15:15] your own people."
[15:16] That conversation stayed with me for
[15:19] years because for a long time we have
[15:22] forgotten that message. You know, we
[15:24] spend the entire industrial age trying
[15:27] to turn ourselves into machines. We
[15:29] measured our worth by our output, our
[15:31] productivity. If we didn't produce or we
[15:34] didn't consume, we didn't matter to the
[15:35] market. So what did we do? We tried to
[15:38] outroot the robots. But now the actual
[15:42] machines have arrived to take their job
[15:44] back. And that's not a threat. That's
[15:47] actually a permission. Permission to us
[15:50] to stop pretending like we're machines.
[15:53] Permission to feel, to show compassion,
[15:56] to connect to those mysteries, to
[15:58] connect to others, to connect to this
[16:00] mystery called life. In a way, I feel
[16:02] that AI and machines are coming to free
[16:05] us from labor so we can return to our
[16:08] essential nature. AI's ultimate gift
[16:12] might very well be then that it will
[16:14] make us more human. If you like this
[16:17] video, here's another one that I think
[16:20] you will like. Thank you and I love
