# Raw Transcript: Claude Cowork Just Became UNSTOPPABLE

[0:00]

Cloud Co-work recently launched plugins Cloud Co-work recently launched plugins and billions of dollars in SAS market and billions of dollars in SAS market and billions of dollars in SAS market cap were instantly wiped out. Plugins cap were instantly wiped out. Plugins

cap were instantly wiped out. Plugins could potentially change the software could potentially change the software could potentially change the software landscape and I think will fundamentally landscape and I think will fundamentally landscape and I think will fundamentally change the way people and companies do

change the way people and companies do change the way people and companies do work. So in this video I'll show you work. So in this video I'll show you work. So in this video I'll show you what plugins are, show you real examples what plugins are, show you real examples

what plugins are, show you real examples of how to use them and how to set them of how to use them and how to set them of how to use them and how to set them up for yourself and I'll explain why up for yourself and I'll explain why up for yourself and I'll explain why plugins could potentially create a whole

plugins could potentially create a whole plugins could potentially create a whole new economy and change the SAS landscape new economy and change the SAS landscape new economy and change the SAS landscape forever. Uh if you haven't used it yet, forever. Uh if you haven't used it yet,

forever. Uh if you haven't used it yet, Cloud Co-work was recently launched by Cloud Co-work was recently launched by Cloud Co-work was recently launched by Entropic and it's a game changanger Entropic and it's a game changanger Entropic and it's a game changanger because Cloud can now access files on

because Cloud can now access files on because Cloud can now access files on your computer here. It can access any your computer here. It can access any your computer here. It can access any software you use and use skills in order software you use and use skills in order

software you use and use skills in order to automate uh some of your day-to-day to automate uh some of your day-to-day to automate uh some of your day-to-day tasks and workflows. Now, if you haven't tasks and workflows. Now, if you haven't tasks and workflows. Now, if you haven't used Cloud Co yet, I released a full

used Cloud Co yet, I released a full used Cloud Co yet, I released a full tutorial recently which I'll make sure tutorial recently which I'll make sure tutorial recently which I'll make sure to link in the description below too, to link in the description below too,

to link in the description below too, but you should be able to follow this but you should be able to follow this but you should be able to follow this video too if you don't know the tool video too if you don't know the tool video too if you don't know the tool yet. Now, Entropic just added plugins to

yet. Now, Entropic just added plugins to yet. Now, Entropic just added plugins to which you can find here in the bottom which you can find here in the bottom which you can find here in the bottom left corner. And as you can see, left corner. And as you can see,

left corner. And as you can see, Enthropic has already built some of Enthropic has already built some of Enthropic has already built some of these plugins for us across all business these plugins for us across all business these plugins for us across all business departments. So we have sales,

departments. So we have sales, departments. So we have sales, productivity, product management, legal, productivity, product management, legal, productivity, product management, legal, finance, uh customer support, etc. Now, finance, uh customer support, etc. Now,

finance, uh customer support, etc. Now, the idea from Entropic is to basically the idea from Entropic is to basically the idea from Entropic is to basically create these plugins packaged into job create these plugins packaged into job create these plugins packaged into job departments. So each plug-in basically

departments. So each plug-in basically departments. So each plug-in basically becomes a specialist in that job becomes a specialist in that job becomes a specialist in that job function. For example, we have the function. For example, we have the

function. For example, we have the customer support plugin here with customer support plugin here with customer support plugin here with specific connectors to customer service specific connectors to customer service specific connectors to customer service platforms and skills on how to do

platforms and skills on how to do platforms and skills on how to do specific tasks relevant to customer specific tasks relevant to customer specific tasks relevant to customer support like customer research, response support like customer research, response

support like customer research, response drafting and escalation. I can use these drafting and escalation. I can use these drafting and escalation. I can use these plugins and skills by just adding a plugins and skills by just adding a plugins and skills by just adding a slash go to plugins and then for example

slash go to plugins and then for example slash go to plugins and then for example go to sales and go to the call prep go to sales and go to the call prep go to sales and go to the call prep skill. But I can also just tell Claude I skill. But I can also just tell Claude I

skill. But I can also just tell Claude I want to prepare for a sales call and it want to prepare for a sales call and it want to prepare for a sales call and it would automatically assume I want to use would automatically assume I want to use would automatically assume I want to use that skill. Now, these entropic plugins

that skill. Now, these entropic plugins that skill. Now, these entropic plugins are great, but as every company or are great, but as every company or are great, but as every company or person is unique, I think the real person is unique, I think the real

person is unique, I think the real unlock is by creating or customizing unlock is by creating or customizing unlock is by creating or customizing them for yourself. Now, before showing them for yourself. Now, before showing them for yourself. Now, before showing you some examples and how to set them

you some examples and how to set them you some examples and how to set them up, let me quickly explain what exactly up, let me quickly explain what exactly up, let me quickly explain what exactly these plugins are, why they can be more these plugins are, why they can be more

these plugins are, why they can be more powerful than just skills, and how these powerful than just skills, and how these powerful than just skills, and how these might fundamentally change the SAS might fundamentally change the SAS might fundamentally change the SAS landscape and the way we work. Now, the

landscape and the way we work. Now, the landscape and the way we work. Now, the simple way to think about plugins is you simple way to think about plugins is you simple way to think about plugins is you can basically see them like a USB stick can basically see them like a USB stick

can basically see them like a USB stick that you can plug into your cloud AI that you can plug into your cloud AI that you can plug into your cloud AI agent to give it specific expertise. And agent to give it specific expertise. And agent to give it specific expertise. And the plug-in consists of a set of skills,

[2:03]

the plug-in consists of a set of skills, the plug-in consists of a set of skills, tools, and commands. It's not a new tools, and commands. It's not a new tools, and commands. It's not a new concept. It's already been rolled out in concept. It's already been rolled out in

concept. It's already been rolled out in cloud code. And Antropics basically cloud code. And Antropics basically cloud code. And Antropics basically using cloud co-work to make all of these using cloud co-work to make all of these using cloud co-work to make all of these new innovations accessible to the

new innovations accessible to the new innovations accessible to the non-developer community and to build it non-developer community and to build it non-developer community and to build it in an environment where it's actually in an environment where it's actually

in an environment where it's actually safe for employees and companies to use safe for employees and companies to use safe for employees and companies to use it internally. And that's why I think it internally. And that's why I think it internally. And that's why I think we'll see huge adoption of cloud co-work

we'll see huge adoption of cloud co-work we'll see huge adoption of cloud co-work this year. Now, let me walk you through this year. Now, let me walk you through this year. Now, let me walk you through these concepts quickly because it's good these concepts quickly because it's good

these concepts quickly because it's good to understand. So, first we have skills. to understand. So, first we have skills. to understand. So, first we have skills. Now, if you don't know it yet, you can Now, if you don't know it yet, you can Now, if you don't know it yet, you can see skills basically as specific

see skills basically as specific see skills basically as specific capabilities. They have a general capabilities. They have a general capabilities. They have a general instruction on how to execute a task or instruction on how to execute a task or

instruction on how to execute a task or a workflow. And this is laid out in a a workflow. And this is laid out in a a workflow. And this is laid out in a skill MD file, which you can basically skill MD file, which you can basically skill MD file, which you can basically see as a system prompt. A skill can then

see as a system prompt. A skill can then see as a system prompt. A skill can then also have specific knowledge sources also have specific knowledge sources also have specific knowledge sources included that it can use to execute on included that it can use to execute on

included that it can use to execute on this process or task. It can have this process or task. It can have this process or task. It can have instructions on how to use tools and instructions on how to use tools and instructions on how to use tools and even how to spin up some sub agents,

even how to spin up some sub agents, even how to spin up some sub agents, etc. For example, I've created a etc. For example, I've created a etc. For example, I've created a LinkedIn writer skill for myself that LinkedIn writer skill for myself that

LinkedIn writer skill for myself that can write in my tone of voice. And in can write in my tone of voice. And in can write in my tone of voice. And in the skill MD, it's just the instructions the skill MD, it's just the instructions the skill MD, it's just the instructions on how to execute this process, how to

on how to execute this process, how to on how to execute this process, how to use the knowledge sources, when to use use the knowledge sources, when to use use the knowledge sources, when to use tools, etc. So, you can see the steps tools, etc. So, you can see the steps

tools, etc. So, you can see the steps are laid out in the skill MD, which is are laid out in the skill MD, which is are laid out in the skill MD, which is just a markdown format, basically a just a markdown format, basically a just a markdown format, basically a system prompt. And then we have

system prompt. And then we have system prompt. And then we have supporting reference document like my supporting reference document like my supporting reference document like my profile background, hook templates, ICP, profile background, hook templates, ICP,

profile background, hook templates, ICP, LinkedIn examples, voice personality, LinkedIn examples, voice personality, LinkedIn examples, voice personality, and what we do. So I'm building many of and what we do. So I'm building many of and what we do. So I'm building many of these skills out for myself for my daily

these skills out for myself for my daily these skills out for myself for my daily tasks and workflows. For example, we tasks and workflows. For example, we tasks and workflows. For example, we also have a case study one here. Here I also have a case study one here. Here I

also have a case study one here. Here I triggered the case study one with a triggered the case study one with a triggered the case study one with a slash. It then loaded the skill to slash. It then loaded the skill to slash. It then loaded the skill to understand how we do case studies. It

understand how we do case studies. It understand how we do case studies. It asked me for a transcript which I gave asked me for a transcript which I gave asked me for a transcript which I gave it and it went through the process of it and it went through the process of

it and it went through the process of creating a case study according to my creating a case study according to my creating a case study according to my brand's guidelines. You can see here if brand's guidelines. You can see here if brand's guidelines. You can see here if you want to use or customize some of our

you want to use or customize some of our you want to use or customize some of our skills, you can also check out my AI skills, you can also check out my AI skills, you can also check out my AI community uh where we list all the community uh where we list all the

community uh where we list all the skills we build internally. And then skills we build internally. And then skills we build internally. And then second, we have connections. Of course, second, we have connections. Of course, second, we have connections. Of course, through connections, Cloud can now

through connections, Cloud can now through connections, Cloud can now connect to all our softwares. We have connect to all our softwares. We have connect to all our softwares. We have built-in connectors from Entropic. We built-in connectors from Entropic. We

built-in connectors from Entropic. We can use MCPs. We can use the browser MCP can use MCPs. We can use the browser MCP can use MCPs. We can use the browser MCP to let Cloud use a browser to access any to let Cloud use a browser to access any to let Cloud use a browser to access any software that doesn't have an MCP yet.

software that doesn't have an MCP yet. software that doesn't have an MCP yet. And of course, we can give Cloud access And of course, we can give Cloud access And of course, we can give Cloud access to files on our computer now too. And in to files on our computer now too. And in

[4:04]

to files on our computer now too. And in the case study uh scale, for example, I the case study uh scale, for example, I the case study uh scale, for example, I could have added a step where after it's could have added a step where after it's could have added a step where after it's generated the PowerPoint, it should

generated the PowerPoint, it should generated the PowerPoint, it should update my CMS um with the link of the update my CMS um with the link of the update my CMS um with the link of the PowerPoint. And I think the reason why PowerPoint. And I think the reason why

PowerPoint. And I think the reason why these connectors are packaged into these connectors are packaged into these connectors are packaged into plugins and not on a companywide level plugins and not on a companywide level plugins and not on a companywide level is because I think companies will not

is because I think companies will not is because I think companies will not want the customer service team for want the customer service team for want the customer service team for example to have access to the sales example to have access to the sales

example to have access to the sales softwares and the other way around. So softwares and the other way around. So softwares and the other way around. So companies will be able to give specific companies will be able to give specific companies will be able to give specific software access to specific departments.

software access to specific departments. software access to specific departments. Then lastly we have commands or slash Then lastly we have commands or slash Then lastly we have commands or slash commands and you can basically just see commands and you can basically just see

commands and you can basically just see them as triggers. It's just a word you them as triggers. It's just a word you them as triggers. It's just a word you use to trigger a specific skill like my use to trigger a specific skill like my use to trigger a specific skill like my LinkedIn writer skill. But maybe even

LinkedIn writer skill. But maybe even LinkedIn writer skill. But maybe even more powerful with these commands is we more powerful with these commands is we more powerful with these commands is we can now set up what we call agentic can now set up what we call agentic

can now set up what we call agentic workflows. And this is basically a workflows. And this is basically a workflows. And this is basically a specific instruction on how to use specific instruction on how to use specific instruction on how to use multiple skills together into one

multiple skills together into one multiple skills together into one workflow to automate even more complex workflow to automate even more complex workflow to automate even more complex tasks. For example, for my YouTube tasks. For example, for my YouTube

tasks. For example, for my YouTube repurposing, I can string together the repurposing, I can string together the repurposing, I can string together the instructions on using the LinkedIn instructions on using the LinkedIn instructions on using the LinkedIn writer skill, then the infographic

writer skill, then the infographic writer skill, then the infographic creator skill, and the newsletter writer creator skill, and the newsletter writer creator skill, and the newsletter writer skill, all with one command. And this skill, all with one command. And this

skill, all with one command. And this can slowly start to look more like can slowly start to look more like can slowly start to look more like automating more complex workflows like automating more complex workflows like automating more complex workflows like you would do in naden or maybe mate.com

you would do in naden or maybe mate.com you would do in naden or maybe mate.com etc. So for example in my marketing etc. So for example in my marketing etc. So for example in my marketing plug-in I have a command set up with plug-in I have a command set up with

plug-in I have a command set up with repurposing and this is just another MD repurposing and this is just another MD repurposing and this is just another MD file with specific instructions file with specific instructions file with specific instructions involving multiple uh skills. So you can

involving multiple uh skills. So you can involving multiple uh skills. So you can see step one invoke LinkedIn post skill see step one invoke LinkedIn post skill see step one invoke LinkedIn post skill and step three is invoke the give and step three is invoke the give

and step three is invoke the give creator skill. So it's just multiple creator skill. So it's just multiple creator skill. So it's just multiple skills mapped together into one skills mapped together into one skills mapped together into one workflow. So you can see here I used the

workflow. So you can see here I used the workflow. So you can see here I used the repurposing command and inside of this repurposing command and inside of this repurposing command and inside of this workflow it used the LinkedIn postwriter workflow it used the LinkedIn postwriter

workflow it used the LinkedIn postwriter skill, the gift creator skill and the skill, the gift creator skill and the skill, the gift creator skill and the newsletter writer. So it created a newsletter writer. So it created a newsletter writer. So it created a LinkedIn post according to my style here

LinkedIn post according to my style here LinkedIn post according to my style here a visual and a gift for the LinkedIn a visual and a gift for the LinkedIn a visual and a gift for the LinkedIn post and a newsletter in my tone of post and a newsletter in my tone of

post and a newsletter in my tone of voice. Now I purposely built in a lot of voice. Now I purposely built in a lot of voice. Now I purposely built in a lot of human in the loop but they can be much human in the loop but they can be much human in the loop but they can be much more autonomous too. Now before showing

more autonomous too. Now before showing more autonomous too. Now before showing you how to set them up and customize you how to set them up and customize you how to set them up and customize them for yourself uh let me quickly go them for yourself uh let me quickly go

them for yourself uh let me quickly go over why this is likely going to be a over why this is likely going to be a over why this is likely going to be a big deal and why the SAS market is a big deal and why the SAS market is a big deal and why the SAS market is a little bit in panic. First of all,

little bit in panic. First of all, little bit in panic. First of all, through these plugins, we can now uh through these plugins, we can now uh through these plugins, we can now uh store all of these common workflows and store all of these common workflows and

store all of these common workflows and tasks for each department in a business tasks for each department in a business tasks for each department in a business in uh into a plug-in. And through cloud in uh into a plug-in. And through cloud in uh into a plug-in. And through cloud co-work, anyone now without any

[6:08]

co-work, anyone now without any co-work, anyone now without any technical understanding in a business technical understanding in a business technical understanding in a business can start automating their day-to-day can start automating their day-to-day

can start automating their day-to-day tasks and workflows across softwares tasks and workflows across softwares tasks and workflows across softwares through skills and agentic workflows.

through skills and agentic workflows. through skills and agentic workflows. And they can be easily made and improved And they can be easily made and improved And they can be easily made and improved without any technical understanding by without any technical understanding by

without any technical understanding by just prompting it. They also become very just prompting it. They also become very just prompting it. They also become very easily sharable and usable by anyone in easily sharable and usable by anyone in easily sharable and usable by anyone in the business. For example, my developer

the business. For example, my developer the business. For example, my developer can now use my uh LinkedIn writer skill can now use my uh LinkedIn writer skill can now use my uh LinkedIn writer skill to write a LinkedIn post according to my to write a LinkedIn post according to my

to write a LinkedIn post according to my specific workflow with my domain specific workflow with my domain specific workflow with my domain expertise and knowledge sources embedded expertise and knowledge sources embedded expertise and knowledge sources embedded and any new employee like this will be

and any new employee like this will be and any new employee like this will be able to do the job 10 times faster. And able to do the job 10 times faster. And able to do the job 10 times faster. And this setup could potentially of course this setup could potentially of course

this setup could potentially of course be much bigger than just automating a be much bigger than just automating a be much bigger than just automating a few tasks. We are still early with this.

few tasks. We are still early with this. few tasks. We are still early with this. We're definitely not there yet. But of We're definitely not there yet. But of We're definitely not there yet. But of course the potential for cloud co-work course the potential for cloud co-work

course the potential for cloud co-work or an AI agent is to become the main or an AI agent is to become the main or an AI agent is to become the main interface for a person or a business to interface for a person or a business to interface for a person or a business to do work. Most of us jump between uh 15

do work. Most of us jump between uh 15 do work. Most of us jump between uh 15 different tools and softwares every day, different tools and softwares every day, different tools and softwares every day, each with their own interface, with each with their own interface, with

each with their own interface, with their own learning curve. But with their own learning curve. But with their own learning curve. But with plugins, cloud can basically be in the plugins, cloud can basically be in the plugins, cloud can basically be in the middle of all of that. You talk to one

middle of all of that. You talk to one middle of all of that. You talk to one interface only and cloud can access all interface only and cloud can access all interface only and cloud can access all of these softwares through plugins and of these softwares through plugins and

of these softwares through plugins and connections. I predict that cloud connections. I predict that cloud connections. I predict that cloud co-work specifically will uh slowly but co-work specifically will uh slowly but co-work specifically will uh slowly but more importantly safely start to add the

more importantly safely start to add the more importantly safely start to add the most popular features from cloud code most popular features from cloud code most popular features from cloud code and open cloud uh like persistent memory and open cloud uh like persistent memory

and open cloud uh like persistent memory proactive messages maybe multi- aent proactive messages maybe multi- aent proactive messages maybe multi- aent teams to make it actually usable for an teams to make it actually usable for an teams to make it actually usable for an average business and a non-developer and

average business and a non-developer and average business and a non-developer and of course SAS companies can be of course SAS companies can be of course SAS companies can be threatened by this when anthropic threatened by this when anthropic

threatened by this when anthropic launched plugins companies like launched plugins companies like launched plugins companies like Salesforce service now and Adobe all saw Salesforce service now and Adobe all saw Salesforce service now and Adobe all saw their stock drop uh because of course if

their stock drop uh because of course if their stock drop uh because of course if the main interface for work really is the main interface for work really is the main interface for work really is slowly becoming agentic through cloud slowly becoming agentic through cloud

slowly becoming agentic through cloud Google or OpenAI, it probably becomes a Google or OpenAI, it probably becomes a Google or OpenAI, it probably becomes a superior interface instead of hopping superior interface instead of hopping superior interface instead of hopping between different tools all the time.

between different tools all the time. between different tools all the time. Now, are all of these SAS going to be Now, are all of these SAS going to be Now, are all of these SAS going to be wiped out? Nobody really knows. I think wiped out? Nobody really knows. I think

wiped out? Nobody really knows. I think we're still very early, but one we're still very early, but one we're still very early, but one potential outcome could be that uh these potential outcome could be that uh these potential outcome could be that uh these SAS businesses will build their own

SAS businesses will build their own SAS businesses will build their own plugins. Some SAS companies are already plugins. Some SAS companies are already plugins. Some SAS companies are already planning to do this. Um, but maybe planning to do this. Um, but maybe

planning to do this. Um, but maybe plugins can potentially become the way a plugins can potentially become the way a plugins can potentially become the way a SAS survives. They can build plugins SAS survives. They can build plugins SAS survives. They can build plugins with their unique workflows, tools, and

with their unique workflows, tools, and with their unique workflows, tools, and functions and potentially plug them into functions and potentially plug them into functions and potentially plug them into an Enthropic or OpenAI plug-in an Enthropic or OpenAI plug-in

an Enthropic or OpenAI plug-in marketplace. And I potentially see three marketplace. And I potentially see three marketplace. And I potentially see three types of plug-in appear. Um, first we'll types of plug-in appear. Um, first we'll types of plug-in appear. Um, first we'll have the Entropicuilt plugins. Right

[8:13]

have the Entropicuilt plugins. Right have the Entropicuilt plugins. Right now, Entropic has released these open now, Entropic has released these open now, Entropic has released these open source plugins for the most common source plugins for the most common

source plugins for the most common business departments, but they've business departments, but they've business departments, but they've already confirmed that organizationwide already confirmed that organizationwide already confirmed that organizationwide sharing and private plug-in marketplaces

sharing and private plug-in marketplaces sharing and private plug-in marketplaces are coming soon to make them more are coming soon to make them more are coming soon to make them more accessible to businesses. Then second, I accessible to businesses. Then second, I

accessible to businesses. Then second, I think we'll see uh thirdparty provider think we'll see uh thirdparty provider think we'll see uh thirdparty provider plugins coming up. Maybe SAS companies plugins coming up. Maybe SAS companies plugins coming up. Maybe SAS companies will start building their own plugins.

will start building their own plugins. will start building their own plugins. We'll probably see other builders We'll probably see other builders We'll probably see other builders providing plugins that could potentially providing plugins that could potentially

providing plugins that could potentially become monetizable. And then lastly, of become monetizable. And then lastly, of become monetizable. And then lastly, of course, we will have loads of customuilt course, we will have loads of customuilt course, we will have loads of customuilt plugins because every business has

plugins because every business has plugins because every business has unique workflows and and ways of doing unique workflows and and ways of doing unique workflows and and ways of doing work. We've been doing this internally.

work. We've been doing this internally. work. We've been doing this internally. We've building out our own Beni We've building out our own Beni We've building out our own Beni marketplace with plugins across each of marketplace with plugins across each of

marketplace with plugins across each of our company departments. And that's our company departments. And that's our company departments. And that's really what I think you should be really what I think you should be really what I think you should be exploring right now, building your own

exploring right now, building your own exploring right now, building your own custom plugins. So how do you set them custom plugins. So how do you set them custom plugins. So how do you set them up and customize them for yourself? Now up and customize them for yourself? Now

up and customize them for yourself? Now there are two main paths. First, we can there are two main paths. First, we can there are two main paths. First, we can use the existing entropic and thirdparty use the existing entropic and thirdparty use the existing entropic and thirdparty provider skills and uh plugins and

provider skills and uh plugins and provider skills and uh plugins and customize them for our unique workflows customize them for our unique workflows customize them for our unique workflows and and ways of working. Entropic made and and ways of working. Entropic made

and and ways of working. Entropic made this really easy to do because in the this really easy to do because in the this really easy to do because in the skills we can basically just use a skill skills we can basically just use a skill skills we can basically just use a skill and ask cla to adapt the skill. For

and ask cla to adapt the skill. For and ask cla to adapt the skill. For example, in the draft outreach message, example, in the draft outreach message, example, in the draft outreach message, uh we can uh tell CL inside of the uh we can uh tell CL inside of the

uh we can uh tell CL inside of the window, please adjust uh the draft window, please adjust uh the draft window, please adjust uh the draft outreach scale and add, let's say, some outreach scale and add, let's say, some outreach scale and add, let's say, some examples of your outreach templates. You

examples of your outreach templates. You examples of your outreach templates. You can also easily customize an entire can also easily customize an entire can also easily customize an entire plug-in here from Entropic by just going plug-in here from Entropic by just going

plug-in here from Entropic by just going here to the plugin and clicking here to the plugin and clicking here to the plugin and clicking customize. And you'll see that you can customize. And you'll see that you can customize. And you'll see that you can just talk to Claude and customize this

just talk to Claude and customize this just talk to Claude and customize this specific sales plugin for your company. specific sales plugin for your company.

specific sales plugin for your company. Now, using and customizing these Now, using and customizing these Now, using and customizing these pre-built ones uh is definitely useful, pre-built ones uh is definitely useful, pre-built ones uh is definitely useful, but I think the real unlock is by

but I think the real unlock is by but I think the real unlock is by building your own. And the way I building your own. And the way I building your own. And the way I recommend doing it is by creating skills recommend doing it is by creating skills

recommend doing it is by creating skills first. Once you have a set of skills, first. Once you have a set of skills, first. Once you have a set of skills, you can bundle them into a plug-in. And you can bundle them into a plug-in. And you can bundle them into a plug-in. And then, if you want to automate more

then, if you want to automate more then, if you want to automate more complex workflows, you can chain complex workflows, you can chain complex workflows, you can chain multiple of these skills together into a multiple of these skills together into a

multiple of these skills together into a gentic command. So, how do you set up gentic command. So, how do you set up gentic command. So, how do you set up these skills? Again, really easy. You these skills? Again, really easy. You these skills? Again, really easy. You can either just tell Claude, can you

can either just tell Claude, can you can either just tell Claude, can you help me create a skill that helps me help me create a skill that helps me help me create a skill that helps me with my YouTube packaging? I lay out the with my YouTube packaging? I lay out the

with my YouTube packaging? I lay out the process of my YouTube packaging with process of my YouTube packaging with process of my YouTube packaging with some additional documents or references.

some additional documents or references. some additional documents or references. and Claude then creates a skill that we and Claude then creates a skill that we and Claude then creates a skill that we can add to our library. And the second can add to our library. And the second

can add to our library. And the second way is to use some of your old projects way is to use some of your old projects way is to use some of your old projects or custom GPTs and transform them into or custom GPTs and transform them into or custom GPTs and transform them into skills, which I've been doing a lot.

[10:15]

skills, which I've been doing a lot. skills, which I've been doing a lot. Again, you can just throw in the system Again, you can just throw in the system Again, you can just throw in the system prompt and any specific documentation prompt and any specific documentation

prompt and any specific documentation you had in your project and CLA can you had in your project and CLA can you had in your project and CLA can build a skill out of it. Now, if you've build a skill out of it. Now, if you've build a skill out of it. Now, if you've already built some skills and you want

already built some skills and you want already built some skills and you want to bundle it into a plug-in and maybe to bundle it into a plug-in and maybe to bundle it into a plug-in and maybe add some agentic commands to it, uh add some agentic commands to it, uh

add some agentic commands to it, uh again, you can do it really easily in again, you can do it really easily in again, you can do it really easily in Entropic. You can literally just ask Entropic. You can literally just ask Entropic. You can literally just ask clot, can you create a plugin for me?

clot, can you create a plugin for me? clot, can you create a plugin for me? Then you can define which skills, Then you can define which skills, Then you can define which skills, connectors, etc. you want to include and connectors, etc. you want to include and

connectors, etc. you want to include and Cloud can build the plugin for you. So Cloud can build the plugin for you. So Cloud can build the plugin for you. So you can see it built the entire plugin you can see it built the entire plugin you can see it built the entire plugin here and then I can just click add to

here and then I can just click add to here and then I can just click add to plugins. Now an important note here is plugins. Now an important note here is plugins. Now an important note here is that all of these plugins or skills that that all of these plugins or skills that

that all of these plugins or skills that you create on your own cloth co-work you create on your own cloth co-work you create on your own cloth co-work account will only be locally saved. So account will only be locally saved. So account will only be locally saved. So if you want to use this across your

if you want to use this across your if you want to use this across your business, other people will not have business, other people will not have business, other people will not have access to it yet. So the easiest way to access to it yet. So the easiest way to

access to it yet. So the easiest way to do that is by just ask to give you a zip do that is by just ask to give you a zip do that is by just ask to give you a zip file so I can share the plug-in across file so I can share the plug-in across file so I can share the plug-in across my team. Right? Cloud will then give you

my team. Right? Cloud will then give you my team. Right? Cloud will then give you a zip file which you can open, share to a zip file which you can open, share to a zip file which you can open, share to other people and other people can then other people and other people can then

other people and other people can then go into their plug-in section and upload go into their plug-in section and upload go into their plug-in section and upload that zip file here. Now, I think Cloud that zip file here. Now, I think Cloud that zip file here. Now, I think Cloud Co is going to make this sharing

Co is going to make this sharing Co is going to make this sharing internally of plugins and even internally of plugins and even internally of plugins and even externally a lot easier very soon. But externally a lot easier very soon. But

externally a lot easier very soon. But for now, if you want to internally or for now, if you want to internally or for now, if you want to internally or even externally want to share these even externally want to share these even externally want to share these plugins or even marketplaces, which are

plugins or even marketplaces, which are plugins or even marketplaces, which are groups of plugins, uh you'd either have groups of plugins, uh you'd either have groups of plugins, uh you'd either have to do it through zip files or through to do it through zip files or through

to do it through zip files or through GitHub. You'd most likely have to set up GitHub. You'd most likely have to set up GitHub. You'd most likely have to set up a marketplace together with clot code.

a marketplace together with clot code. a marketplace together with clot code. Now, uh, Entropic released a full guide Now, uh, Entropic released a full guide Now, uh, Entropic released a full guide on how to do this, which I'll make sure on how to do this, which I'll make sure

on how to do this, which I'll make sure to link in the description below, too, to link in the description below, too, to link in the description below, too, if you're interested in actually if you're interested in actually if you're interested in actually deploying it maybe on a marketplace or

deploying it maybe on a marketplace or deploying it maybe on a marketplace or really companywide through a GitHub really companywide through a GitHub really companywide through a GitHub link. But again, I think Cloudco work link. But again, I think Cloudco work

link. But again, I think Cloudco work will make this a lot easier very soon. will make this a lot easier very soon. will make this a lot easier very soon. Again, if you want to check out some of Again, if you want to check out some of Again, if you want to check out some of the plugins and skills we've been
