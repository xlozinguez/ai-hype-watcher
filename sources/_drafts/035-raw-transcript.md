[0:00] 95% of engineers use Codex. 100% of our PRs are reviewed by Codex for engineers.

[0:30] problems that you're describing. And so usually you're like all right I'll roll

[1:00] don't want to miss the boat." Make sure you're building for where the models are

[1:30] thrive in the AI era, organizations need to adapt quickly. But many organization

[2:00] Applications break in all kinds of ways. Crashes, slowdowns, regressions, and the

[2:30] down, and what users saw. Seir, Sentry's AI debugging agent, takes it from there.

[3:00] percentage of your code, if you even write code anymore, and your team's code

[3:30] >> I do write code occasionally now still. Uh and I actually say for managers like

[4:00] good Codeex as a tool has gotten for us. And uh it's it's a little hard for us to

[4:30] energy that that there that there is. Um another observation that we've had is uh

[5:00] >> Okay. So just to make sure we hear what you're saying you're saying all of the

[5:30] that I can do and and kind of like the their bar of of trust kind of uh or like

[6:00] >> Yeah. Uh Peter the Claudebot/moldbotclaw is what it's called now. uh developer uh

[6:30] >> Open claw is a great is a great product. And then I saw that this I mean this is

[7:00] engineers in particular. We've gone from you write every line of code to now AI

[7:30] significantly over the next one to two years. It kind of feels like we're still

[8:00] parallel threads. They're checking in on what they're doing. They're steering the

[8:30] introductory it was the textbook for the intro programming course for a very long

[9:00] this metaphor to basically like sorcery. Like it says like software engineers are

[9:30] like what software engineering will look like because programming languages were

[10:00] kind of get them the the the computer to do what you want uh via programming. And

[10:30] like go crazy and everything's flooding. I think he literally sets the like sets

[11:00] it's like vi coding at it at its at its greatest and then eventually the the old

[11:30] these tools uh can now just do way more things via what they're doing. And and I

[12:00] that you can that grants you wishes and it's a useful frame because you have to

[12:30] >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it happens all the time. And I actually think like this is

[13:00] you know uh uh some you know you'll have the AI write code but you'll obviously

[13:30] so then the challenge like how do I get the the the agent to to to do this? And

[14:00] noticed, I I don't know if this is what you you kind of feel, but we definitely

[14:30] comments itself or code structure itself or via text files like you know MD files

[15:00] >> Another uh issue people run into, you talked about how people are shipping PRs

[15:30] software engineering. It's also why it's more fun now because we get to do more,

[16:00] reviewing code. Uh so actually one thing that we've noticed that 52 in particular

[16:30] bunch of suggestions uh already already baked in. Uh a lot of the times people

[17:00] general CI process and like the post uh kind of push and like deployment process

[17:30] know, if there's like a lint error, it's a very easy codeex fix. Uh and then just

[18:00] their PRs. Uh, and so it's not like it's going to zero. It's more like going from

[18:30] give you a different perspective um here as well and and we found that to to work

[19:00] so I understand and then I want to move on to a different topic. Uh 100% of code

[19:30] for managers just uh just yet. However, I use codeex quite a bit for for some of

[20:00] say a couple things are are changing. There like some trends. So I don't think

[20:30] noticing this now as well, which is like the top performers kind of end up uh uh

[21:00] like really be shooting ahead uh using these tools. I think I think one example

[21:30] The other thing is I I so this is more uh an observation but my sense is with a

[22:00] Google docs to give it get a really good sense of what this person has done over

[22:30] we're already seeing this. There's some teams uh where there are EM managing you

[23:00] >> And what you're saying here is just just doing this more and more is probably the

[23:30] >> Yeah. A very good example right now is uh there are I would say like a a group

[24:00] into where things are heading? Just like what's an example of something you think

[24:30] uh like phrases or like things that have come out of this whole AI wave is is the

[25:00] billion dollars. But I think there are a couple other implications of this. One

[25:30] also means it's way easier for people to just create startups in general. Like I

[26:00] startups building bespoke software that works extremely well to support uh other

[26:30] way more of these these these startups. So the way I I' I've been thinking about

[27:00] and so you know we might really see see an explosion in that way and and I feel

[27:30] there's a lot of uncertainty I think if we end up moving to this world where you

[28:00] million uh companies. Uh, which are not great for venture solid returns, but are

[28:30] because I I'm not going to be a billion dollar startup because what I'm doing is

[29:00] contractors which I don't know does that count as a single person company I feel

[29:30] on it is is is slightly different, which is I think that your, you know, Lenny's

[30:00] you know they might be able to just code up this product very very easily. They

[30:30] >> Yeah. there's like a question of like what you in-house and what you what you

[31:00] absolutely insane. It it's probably like um uh you know like the the months after

[31:30] there are so many freaking things trying to get your attention. So people with an

[32:00] >> Yeah. Um, I I think a lot of the lessons that I've learned here, I don't know how

[32:30] like to be very concrete, like it's like more than 50% of your time with your top

[33:00] they actually described this world where um I think they were like predicting the

[33:30] always really liked that analogy and and and and uh that analogy is actually what

[34:00] person doing work but the way in which I like treating the people on my team and

[34:30] manager can kind of look around corners and kind of unblock the team if you can

[35:00] >> I love that. And I I feel like I wonder if that's something AI can help with is

[35:30] this team in the in the coming months or >> Yeah. You asked the you asked the model.

[36:00] and third order things. Anticipate that, man. Anticipate what the bloggers will

[36:30] actually diagnose the impact of funnel drop offs and bugs and UX friction. Once

[37:00] can roll out safely, target precisely, and learn continuously. Data Dog is more

[37:30] all build. Some So, you work with a lot of companies implementing your API, your

[38:00] >> Yeah. So, so to be clear, I I I don't like explicitly see quantitative numbers

[38:30] Silicon Valley just forget that we live in a bubble. Like we are so like Twitter

[39:00] model release. And so uh uh and so we're just like highly out of the loop on how

[39:30] yet. And so that kind of goes back to that kind of ties into to to what I what

[40:00] of both top down buyin. So it's like the seuite it's like you know we're we're we

[40:30] different than finance is different than operations different than go to market

[41:00] bottoms up fashion. And so my sense is a lot of these these AI deployments don't

[41:30] >> and who who would you put on this tiger team is it like engineerled do you find

[42:00] >> Yeah, it's it's interesting. So, um also a lot of companies don't have software

[42:30] those are the kinds of people I've seen in these companies who just like really

[43:00] >> And the advice is find the people that are most excited and instead of kind of

[43:30] >> Yeah. I mean another it's kind of like hearing you you play back to me. Another

[44:00] seen you talk about and share. one is um you've shared that talking to customers

[44:30] Nicholas who's who's the founder of a a startup called finol uh where uh I think

[45:00] scaffolding and and things especially in the developer space to basically try and

[45:30] better that they ended up yeah literally eating some of some of the scaffolding.

[46:00] useful now um there was a period of time like 2023 where we thought vector stores

[46:30] be files on a file system like skills uh and agents MD uh to kind of steer it uh

[47:00] to your customers they'll be like yeah I want a better vector store like I want a

[47:30] right now will likely need to evolve and change pretty significantly over time um

[48:00] you add to to machine learning to AI the more it'll be able to scale and grow and

[48:30] just just compute basically just give it more power to to get smarter on its own.

[49:00] >> My general advice and I've been giving this to people for a while and I think

[49:30] of capability that is like maybe 80% of the way there today and it like they end

[50:00] >> So to follow that thread, where are like in the next six to 12 months, where is

[50:30] meter benchmark that that I think tracks software engineering tasks and how long,

[51:00] So you can really see the trend of this. That's something that I'm really excited

[51:30] could do multi-hour long tasks very very coherently. At some point it might reach

[52:00] 12 to 18 months I think be really cool is improvements in our in the multimodal

[52:30] multimodal audio side uh as well but uh audio especially in the enterprise and

[53:00] next 12 to 18 months. And I think there will be uh even more unlock for uh what

[53:30] >> extremely cool. Okay, I want to go back to one of your hot takes, another hot

[54:00] than the work that goes on um that runs our entire economy and I see this in and

[54:30] tech jobs are in the space I think like data science is kind of in the space as

[55:00] being done in the world is actually just um running through these procedures and

[55:30] about it. But how can we apply um AI uh and and some of the tools and frameworks

[56:00] decisions and and and different systems within an enterprise um and how can we

[56:30] also just impact how work is done like so much of work is done in this way like

[57:00] well. But it is pretty massive and it's definitely bigger than you know uh uh uh

[57:30] building on the API the biggest question on people's minds is always just uh how

[58:00] seen that has kind of fizzled out is not because open AI or you know big lab or

[58:30] investing in like competitive companies left and right is just like the space is

[59:00] people like don't don't overthink about it. The other thing like I also think is

[59:30] and not squash it. And so if you kind of look at the decisions we make it this is

[60:00] signin with chatgbt you know uh product as well and so we we want to foster this

[60:30] >> Why why is that important to open AAI? Just this focus on building a platform,

[61:00] like spread the benefits of it to all of humanity and there's kind of like a lot

[61:30] 2020 or something like really early we don't think we as a company will be able

[62:00] >> Yeah. Is is that under your umbrella by the way or is that a different Oregon

[62:30] ultimately we think it'll help us expand that that that group as well, right? And

[63:00] >> weekly act billion people using weekly just like it's absurd how many how these

[63:30] it costs money and it's like uh like the fact that it it's there's a free version

[64:00] >> Yeah. Yeah. I mean like uh that that's why I think we've leaned into the health

[64:30] iPhone that like you know Steve or sorry like Mark Zuckerberg's probably using or

[65:00] probably not using pro for everything. They're probably just using the the plus

[65:30] sample from our models. The most popular one that we have right now is one called

[66:00] whatever you want. It's like the lowest level thing. We've also started building

[66:30] extremely popular. Um this allows you to use you know the responses API or some

[67:00] tools to help also with kind of like the meta level of deploying an agent. Uh so

[67:30] eval products like an eval API where if you want to test and like you know see

[68:00] >> Sherwin, is there anything else that you want to share? Anything else you want to

[68:30] granted. Like I I entered the workforce in 2014. It was great for like a couple

[69:00] for granted. At some point you know this wave is going to play out and it's going

[69:30] don't need to be a software engineer to to lean into this. Um, all I think a lot

[70:00] uh uh uh letting it letting it pass you. >> On the flip side of that, there's a lot

[70:30] basically chronically online uh on X and uh our company Slack. So I I I actually

[71:00] combination of like the frenetic pace of the industry X as a product just creates

[71:30] >> Oh, I'll I'll talk about one non-fiction one and one fiction book. Uh the fiction

[72:00] it's like an online author, but I saw it being shared on X. Uh this this uh it's

[72:30] hilarious. So like it's like meant to be like this like sci-fi almost like horror

[73:00] good. I really liked his analogy of like the lawyerly US is the lawyerly society.

[73:30] >> The antiimetics book sounds amazing. I'm buying it right now as you're talking.

[74:00] and so I really haven't had much time um to watch TV shows. Uh I will say in the

[74:30] just had a very simple setup. Uh, and it is just such a well-built product. Uh, I

[75:00] it. Um, but I actually think what makes it really good are security cameras. So,

[75:30] and Apple TV app and iPad app um to kind of see the live feed of your cameras and

[76:00] agency to kind of pull yourselves up is something that I've had to tell myself a

[76:30] like are super super uh actually impact your price quite a lot. I didn't really

[77:00] like and what a really bad floor plan is like we were doing all these things of

[77:30] then like where's the master bedroom and and so it was just really really hard to

[78:00] replacement tends to be the highest ROI uh for homes. Um but just like the feel

[78:30] and how can listeners be useful to you? Yeah. So, I'm uh online on on Twitter on

[79:00] >> Amazing. Sherwin, thank you so much for being here. Yeah. Thank you, Lenny.
