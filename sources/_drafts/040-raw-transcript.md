# Raw Transcript: 040

[0:00] If you are using Claude code and you're not yet using Carl, you're giving directions to Claude to every city in the country when it only needs directions to get to the grocery store. And the more directions you give it, the worse it drives. In this video, I'm going to show you exactly what's happening and how to fix it using this awesome plugin called Carl. >> Carl, that kills people. >> Oh. >> Be amazed and take a look. This is my claw.md file. all 733 lines. Build

[0:30] standards, agent team setups, plug-in rules, content strategies, operating principles. It's everything about me. And here's the thing, every single one of these rules is good. I wrote them all because they matter. The problem isn't what's in here. The problem is all 733 lines are loaded into every single prompt. For example, I ask Claude to fix a bug and it's pulling context on content strategy. or I ask it to write a YouTube script and it's pulling context about get work trees. That's like asking your city to fix a pothole and they

[1:00] start by reviewing the entire federal budget. The pothole doesn't get fixed and they burn through a ton of money, aka our tokens. Here's what most people don't realize. Claude has 1 million tokens of context per each window. Your claw.md eats up about 15 to 20% of your context window before you even message anything. And that's not just fewer tokens for your work, it's worse output. As context fills up, Claude's output quality degrades, especially attention to early instructions. So when Claude

[1:30] gets irrelevant instructions, it doesn't just ignore them. They actively dilute its attention throughout the whole conversation. The model is trying to follow this when it only needs 28 rules. You're burning tokens this way. But also, it's not even just a token problem. It's a signal to noise problem. And don't worry, there's a fix. Before I introduce the solution, aka Carl, if you're getting value out of this, hit the like button and subscribe because I do claude workflow reviews like this

[2:00] every single week. This is Carl Context augmentation reinforcement layer built by my partner Chris Kaylor here at CNC Strategic. And if you're in the cloud code space at all, you should definitely remember this name. Here's the idea in plain English. Instead of one massive claw.md file that loads everything every single time, Carl will break up your rules into separate domains. Small separate groups of rules that are organized by what they do. You would

[2:30] configure the global domain for rules that should always be applied. Universal rules like your name, your coding standards, your communication style. For me, it's nine rules. Everything else only loads when Carl sees that the prompt is relevant. You mention YouTube. Claude will intelligently use Claw to detect that it should use the content rules. You mentioned TypeScript. It's going to pull the dev domain. The rest will stay out of our way throughout our conversation. I'm going to show you how this works live. Notice how the Claude MD was trimmed from 734 lines down to

[3:00] 153 lines. And it'll organize my entire structure into separate domains and strategic star commands. And I'm going to show you how I use it in a real conversation. I'm going to boot open a new session of Claude and I'm going to ask it to write me a YouTube script about Carl. So notice how Claude is exploring the Carl system and it's going to look for specific keywords that are going to match the domain configurations. And in this case, it's only going to load my global settings and my content settings. And we're only

[3:30] going to load 28 rules rather than 700 plus lines. Carl sees YouTube and script and matches it with the content domain. 19 rules about my voice, my audience, hoax psychology, and content strategy, plus the nine global rules. So, 28 in total. And look what it didn't load. Anything about LinkedIn, dev, clients, agents, and everything else that I had structured in my MD. So, it's done researching. Now, watch what happens when I switch context. I'm asking it to do some dev work. Now, in the same way,

[4:00] Carl's going to search for those keywords and match it with my dev domain. So, notice it pulled the dev domain because it matched the keywords. Now, in the same way, if I open up a new context window and I ask it that same prompt, it's only going to pull the domain for dev and the global rules, and it'll only pull 23 of the rules. So, we're getting laser focused development. Same project, same Carl installation, two totally different rule sets based off of what I've actually asked for. That's the key difference in using Carl. Domains are automatic. Carl reads your

[4:30] prompt and figures what to load. But sometimes you want explicit control on those rules. That's why Carl gives us star commands. These are the particular star commands that I've created using Carl. One for dev, review, brief, plan. So if I use star brief, I'm going to get bullets only. It's going to cut all the fluff. So let's say you type in star brief. Claude would switch to bullet points only. No paragraph, no fluff, only answers. Or let's say I did star

[5:00] dev. I would get code over explanation. Show me the fix don't tell me about it type conversation or explicit rules using the star plan command. Look at the difference. Same prompt, one without the star brief command and one with it. Without the command, I get a whole novel when I asked about my dev rules. With it, I get clear-cut bullet points, a simple cheat sheet. Domains are autopilot. Star commands are manual override. You're not hoping Claude reads your mind. You're telling it exactly how to respond. Now, here's something most

[5:30] claw.md structures completely ignore. What happens when your session gets longer? Your context window fills up over time. At the start of the session, you got plenty of room. Claude is pretty comprehensive at this point, but very quickly, it starts running short. And if Claude is giving you three paragraph explanations when context is running low, that's a huge problem. Carl handles this automatically with context brackets. And there's three levels to the logic. When you're fresh, you've got room. Claude will go pretty deep with

[6:00] you. When context starts to fill up and Carl sees that we're in a moderate bracket, Claude will switch to a more concise style of communication automatically. Now, when you're depleted, it's going to turn into survival mode. Code only, no explanations, only if it's asked. It will now even start to speak out loud to remind itself of its prime directive and urge you to create a handoff document if you're not using a special plugin like GSD or whatnot. Carl does what Congress won't. It cuts the bloat automatically when resources run low. No vote

[6:30] required. This is the Carl manifest. All controlled by one file. Each domain has four fields. State, it's either active or it's not. Recall, the keyword that triggered the domain. Exclude keywords that prevent it from loading even if there's a match. And always on. Set this to true and it loads every session like global settings. The beauty is adding more domains doesn't slow Claude down or Carl. Carl just scans your prompt, checks the manifest, and loads what matches. 10 domains, 20 domains, it

[7:00] doesn't matter. Only the relevant ones are going to activate. Let me show you how to install it. It's actually very simple. And the command is going to be below in the description, but you're just going to put in npxcarl core. Click enter. Choose global. You would choose yes. And that's it. your manifest, global rules, commands folder, context brackets, all under 30 seconds. Just restart Claude and Carl is active. So no API keys, no configuration files, no Docker, no build step, just one command.

[7:30] And here's the side by side. Without Carl, we're loading all lines of the claw.md. And with it, we're segregating all those rules with domains and start commands. Massive context consumed from the beginning versus minimal context consumed. Using Carl, we're getting generic instructions for every prompt. The signal is just going to be buried in noise. With Carl and just the 28 rules loaded with an individual prompt, we're getting targeted intelligence for exactly what we're doing. And it auto adapts as your session continues on.

[8:00] Same project, same claude, drastically different performance. Here's the thing people get wrong about AI tools. They think the goal is to make Claude smarter, giving it more information, more context, more rules. It's not. Claude is already super intelligent. The goal is to make Claude more focused. Carl doesn't necessarily add intelligence. It's removing noise. And in every system I've ever built, in business, in automation, in life, focused is going to be smart every

[8:30] single time. If you want to try Carl, grab the command from below. It's free and it's open source. If you want to go deeper on claude code workflows, I have a school community that you can join from the description below. I share everything that works for me and I recently have a promotion. There's no pressure, but as a premium member, you get access to my full SAS building system from A to Z using something called GSD, another Claw Code plugin. If you want access to that video, it'll be

[9:00] linked somewhere above here. And the premium membership is only available for a short time as I'm building out the premium courses. But seriously, unlike the US government, you don't get to just print more tokens when you run out. So, stop wasting the ones that you have. I'll see you guys on the next one.
