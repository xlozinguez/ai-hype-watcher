[00:00] Cloud Co just dropped and it is a
[00:02] superpower, but only if you know how to
[00:05] use it correctly. It can even do things
[00:07] that weren't possible before, like
[00:08] automating boring tasks and learning
[00:11] skills, saving you hours. And in this
[00:13] video, I'm going to show you exactly how
[00:15] to unlock its full capabilities using
[00:17] skills that I've not seen anybody else
[00:19] talking about so you can actually save
[00:21] more time and make more money with your
[00:23] business. And if you don't know who I
[00:25] am, my name is Jack Roberts. I built and
[00:27] sold my last tech startup with over
[00:28] 60,000 customers and now I run a very
[00:31] profitable AI automation business. So if
[00:33] you haven't already, grab that coffee
[00:35] and let's dive straight in. Club Co is
[00:38] called Code for work. Basically, it can
[00:40] run multiple tasks at the exact same
[00:43] time. It can automate stuff in your
[00:45] browser, which is huge. Basically, it
[00:47] can unlock different capabilities that
[00:48] aren't accessible necessarily through an
[00:51] API. Had this in my last business. It
[00:52] can just do things for you in the
[00:54] browser. On top of that, it can do it
[00:56] while you're sat on the sofa drinking a
[00:58] flat wine or playing Fortnite. Claude
[01:00] can actually do this. So, you can do
[01:02] other things while Claude co-workers
[01:03] actually working for you and doing
[01:05] things. And it also connects to many of
[01:07] your apps via something called MCP,
[01:09] which stands for model context protocol.
[01:11] Basically, universal remote control lets
[01:13] Claude pretty much talk to anything. And
[01:15] also, generally speaking, it is safe.
[01:17] There are certain things that you need
[01:19] to be care of with the browser controls,
[01:20] but I'll touch on that later. Now, this
[01:22] obviously has also Claude Opus 4.6. So,
[01:25] Claude's most powerful, most cable
[01:27] model, but literally just dropped. And
[01:29] it has a wonderful 1 million context
[01:32] window, which means plenty of room to
[01:34] chat and move around with. Now, how
[01:36] about anti-gravity? Well, when you
[01:39] compare Cloud Co-work with anti-gravity,
[01:41] there is a little overlap. I'd suggest
[01:44] that you think of them both like this.
[01:45] Anti-gravity team is like hiring a
[01:47] developer to build you custom software.
[01:49] Whereas Cloud Co-work is like hiring an
[01:52] assistant who uses your computer, your
[01:54] files, your login and does the work for
[01:57] you. They both automate workflows,
[01:59] create documents, create context, but
[02:01] anti-gravity builds your business tools
[02:03] whereas co-work runs your business
[02:05] dayto-day. There are certain number of
[02:07] tasks where using anti-gravity is
[02:10] unbelievably the better option and cloud
[02:13] co-work excels at different things. So
[02:14] they're fundamentally different
[02:16] platforms, but there's a little bit of
[02:17] overlap if you're wondering. So
[02:18] anti-gravity is still this unbelievable
[02:20] force of nature. Claude Co is just
[02:23] something that we're adding to unlock
[02:24] some new capabilities with some really
[02:26] interesting use cases. Now the very best
[02:28] way to understand Claude Co is to
[02:30] actually use it to build something
[02:32] practical that you're going to use. So
[02:34] I'm going to show you across five
[02:35] incredible use cases where the use cases
[02:38] get better as they go on. Five being the
[02:40] most incredible. And during that, I'll
[02:41] show you all the really cool features
[02:43] that sit within Claude Cowork. Starting
[02:45] with how to access it. So, you're going
[02:46] to come over to claude.com/d download to
[02:49] download the Claude desktop app. And
[02:51] then you're also going to need to be, I
[02:53] believe, at least on the normal plan,
[02:55] the individual plan, which is like $20 a
[02:57] month. So, you can actually physically
[02:58] use it. Now, when you download it, you
[03:00] will appear and see something great that
[03:02] looks something like this, which is why
[03:04] skill number one is file management. And
[03:06] so, the best thing to show you initially
[03:07] is to show you how it works on your
[03:09] laptop. Right? So, for example, if you
[03:10] check out my desktop, it is a little bit
[03:12] on the busy side. So, what we're going
[03:14] to do now is actually get Claude to
[03:16] organize some of this for us. And as you
[03:17] can see at the top, we've got chat,
[03:19] cowork, and code. So, let's just say I
[03:20] want to tidy up my desktop. What I can
[03:22] do is click on work in a folder. And
[03:23] then we do is select the folder like
[03:25] desktop right here. And then click down
[03:27] and click on open. Then once you've done
[03:28] that, it'll ask for confirmation. We
[03:30] just click on allow. That's fine. And
[03:31] then we can give it a prompt. And I
[03:33] might say, "Hey Claude, could you do me
[03:34] a favor? Could you go to my desktop,
[03:36] grab me all of my images on the desktop
[03:38] and put them in a images folder just
[03:40] like that, right? Come down here and
[03:42] say, "Let's go." And what code will do
[03:44] then is just take these actions for you.
[03:46] It's also a little side hack by the way.
[03:48] Really good at finding lost files. Like
[03:50] I actually lost a video file and I was
[03:51] like, "You need to go and find it for
[03:52] me. It's here somewhere." And it dug
[03:54] through and found it out. It was really
[03:55] excellent at that. And just like that,
[03:56] guys, we can see all 50 PGs have been
[03:59] moved to a new images folder. So, let's
[04:00] just check out if that's happened. And
[04:02] right there you can see I now have an
[04:03] images folder with all 50 images on
[04:05] there which is pretty crazy. So then you
[04:07] can actually ask it questions about any
[04:08] content your files. For example, I could
[04:10] say hey I've got some information about
[04:12] a niche that I'm interested in. It's
[04:14] called business context on my desk my
[04:16] desktop. Could you just check that out
[04:18] and give me I don't know a two sentence
[04:20] summary please send that one off and
[04:22] they can go. Now core thing to
[04:23] understand is when you're using clawed
[04:25] co-work you always do it within the
[04:27] folder. So you're deciding where it's
[04:28] happening. That could be your desktop.
[04:30] It could be your downloads or a specific
[04:32] folder that you have there. So called
[04:33] coowork will then go ahead and find that
[04:35] folder for us and give us the answer.
[04:37] And just like that the file covers the
[04:38] speechto text transcription niche. And
[04:40] again we can do this with any number of
[04:41] files we want to. It has this kind of
[04:43] full access. Now organizing files on
[04:45] your desktop and talking to your
[04:46] computer is one thing but we can take
[04:48] this to a completely new level by
[04:50] actually taking cloud co-work into our
[04:52] browser which means that we can access
[04:54] services and do automations that you
[04:56] just literally cannot do for a simple
[04:58] API call. Now to use this feature you
[05:00] need to install Claude in your Chrome
[05:02] browser. Chrome is the browser that
[05:04] prefers to use. You can come down to
[05:05] update going to come down here on the
[05:07] right hand side to extensions and click
[05:09] on uh visit web store or manage chrome
[05:12] extensions if you've already got it. And
[05:13] then here all you're going to do is
[05:14] simply come in type in Claude and it
[05:16] shall appear once you type its wonderful
[05:19] name and then you just install it. Now,
[05:20] when that's installed, you'll see this
[05:22] little Claude thing here that exists.
[05:23] And then when I click on that, Claude is
[05:25] now almost in the browser with us,
[05:27] hanging out and having a rock good time.
[05:28] And we can ask it questions about
[05:30] anything on the page generally, uh, what
[05:32] we're doing, wherever we want to. So,
[05:34] say for example, you're on any kind of
[05:35] website and you want some help, you
[05:36] could just click on this button here and
[05:38] just say to Claude, "Hey there, help me
[05:40] find the best laptop, which is a good
[05:41] balance of quality and price." Throw
[05:44] that one off there. And then now Claude
[05:45] can follow you in any browser you do. It
[05:46] will go through, it will come up with a
[05:48] bit of a plan and then it will execute
[05:49] on that plan and then give you the
[05:50] information. Crucial point being here
[05:52] though is that we can approve it and
[05:54] then leave it and then go back over to
[05:56] whatever it is we were doing over here
[05:57] and we don't need to think about it and
[05:59] then when we check back in, we can
[06:00] actually get the results. So let's
[06:01] actually give this an example of
[06:03] something it could do in the browser for
[06:05] us. Let's say for example, I wanted to
[06:07] know what the sentiment was on my last
[06:09] YouTube video. I could give it a prompt
[06:11] that sounds something like this. Hey
[06:12] dude, I want you to go over to the Jack
[06:14] Roberts YouTube channel, check out the
[06:15] latest video and just give me the TLDDR
[06:18] of what the comments were on that video,
[06:19] please. Like that. Really simple. In
[06:22] plain English, I've done this. I'm going
[06:23] to say, "Let's go." So, what Claude will
[06:25] do now is open up Chrome, check the
[06:28] channel out, bring that information back
[06:29] to me, and I wouldn't need to do
[06:31] anything. Now, we have like an API we
[06:33] could use to scrape this, but there are
[06:35] many circumstances in which you don't
[06:36] necessarily have that ability to come
[06:39] and API call something. And this is
[06:40] where it gets really crazy. And when
[06:42] Claude wants to go ahead and use your
[06:44] browser, it will give you a prompt like
[06:45] this. So you can say, do you want to
[06:46] allow for this website? You can say
[06:48] whatever you want to. We'll say that is
[06:50] absolutely fine. Then you can see hands
[06:52] off now. It's heading over to
[06:54] youtube.com. Then it should go ahead and
[06:56] search for my channel. And it will
[06:58] almost almost like a ghost in the
[06:59] browser do essentially anything you've
[07:01] commanded to do, which is freaking epic.
[07:03] Come back over to Claude, see what it's
[07:04] up to, and it just kind of runs like
[07:06] this basically without you touching
[07:07] anything. And it can do all these tasks
[07:09] sequentially for you. You can see he's
[07:10] come back in. He's tapped in my name and
[07:12] my channel should pop up. There I am.
[07:13] And let's see exactly what it comes back
[07:15] with. And you can see it gives you a
[07:16] running commentary of everything it's
[07:17] doing. Good. I can see more comments
[07:19] now. Let me keep on scrolling. I can
[07:20] come back over and see what it's doing.
[07:22] And it's basically just on the web page
[07:23] now scrolling and doing everything for
[07:25] us. Okay. So, come down now. It's given
[07:27] me a bit of a good overview. It's like
[07:29] basically explained some stuff that's
[07:30] happened here, the general hype, the
[07:32] general feelings, which is cool. But
[07:33] let's say for example, what's another
[07:34] use case that you might use? Well, let's
[07:36] say that you get a new lead into your
[07:37] business, right? and you're like, "Okay,
[07:38] someone's reached out to me. They want
[07:40] to work with us." I might say something
[07:41] like, "Hey, dude. I just had an inquiry
[07:43] from a company called House of Coco in
[07:45] Leeds. Do me a quick favor. Go research
[07:47] them and then create me a document
[07:48] that's no greater than 500 words. Save
[07:50] it on my desktop about competitive
[07:52] analysis. I want to know everything
[07:54] about them. Uh, make it look great."
[07:56] Something like that. I can just send
[07:57] this off, fire it off, let it go, and
[07:59] co-work for us in the background. And
[08:01] just like that, it's completed it. We've
[08:02] got everything we need. And so now I
[08:04] should be able to click on this button
[08:05] and open it up. and it's pulled up for
[08:06] me on the right hand side, too. Plus,
[08:08] I've got the doc saved me on the
[08:09] homepage. So, it's just a really cool
[08:11] interface for building documents and
[08:13] pages and things like that on your
[08:15] laptop. And you get Leads UK. It knew
[08:17] that, which is fantastic. Come down and
[08:18] you can see everything it's got on the
[08:20] business. So, now we've covered how to
[08:21] do everything on your laptop and in your
[08:23] browser. The next thing we're going to
[08:25] look at is how we can actually connect
[08:26] Claude Co-work to your life. basically
[08:28] like things like email and any other
[08:30] services you have, which basically makes
[08:32] it like a 500 IQ personal assistant that
[08:35] you can use for pretty much anything.
[08:36] And to do that, we're going to come over
[08:37] and we're going to open up a brand new
[08:39] tab. And I'll show you exactly what I
[08:40] mean. So the way that this works here is
[08:42] something called connectors. Okay? So
[08:44] you're going to come down to this plus
[08:45] here. And you can see you've got a few
[08:46] different options. You've got include
[08:48] project and you've got connectors. So
[08:50] connectors are basically things that
[08:52] Claude can connect to. So for instance,
[08:54] I you can connect to Gmail search,
[08:55] calendar search, whatever you want to.
[08:57] But if you come down here to manage
[08:58] connectors, you'll see a big list. You
[09:01] can also access this in the settings
[09:04] tab. But as you can see, you've got all
[09:05] these different things. And there's a
[09:06] whole uh store that you can browse at
[09:08] the top here by clicking on browse
[09:09] connectors. And this is the kind of if
[09:12] you want Alexandria's library of cool
[09:13] stuff that you could chat to if you want
[09:15] to, which is awesome. For our purposes,
[09:17] what we're going to connect to today is
[09:18] we're going to two things to show how
[09:20] cool this is. Number one is going to be
[09:21] Gmail. So all we're going to do is click
[09:23] on connect and we're going to click on
[09:24] continue. We authorize the access and
[09:26] look how easy the setup is. It opens up.
[09:28] We click on continue. It asks us to sign
[09:30] in right here to provide it with the
[09:32] unique special code that it wants cuz it
[09:33] wants to make ultra sure that it's fine.
[09:35] You'll then be connected to Gmail. So we
[09:37] can ask it questions about emails that
[09:39] we've got. And then finally, once you've
[09:40] authorized, you're going to come down
[09:42] and click on continue. And then we'll be
[09:43] fully connected over to cloud code,
[09:44] which means we can now ask it questions
[09:46] about that. So we're happy with that.
[09:47] We'll click on continue. Once we come
[09:49] back, we can see Gmail is connected. And
[09:50] we can do the same thing with our
[09:51] calendar, which I highly recommend
[09:52] because then you have context on all
[09:54] your meetings at the same time. So,
[09:55] let's also connect that. And the cool
[09:57] thing is you can also connect it to your
[09:58] bank. And I did that and I asked it
[10:00] questions about my bank, my
[10:01] transactions. And actually, it was
[10:03] profoundly helpful. I saw it break this
[10:05] thing down for me. My accountant wants
[10:07] to know XYZ. And it said, Jack, here's
[10:09] all the information. You can even
[10:10] connect to notion. It's just very, very
[10:12] easy one-click connections here. And one
[10:14] of the hacks as well, guys, is the Canva
[10:16] one here. If you check this out, this is
[10:18] actually crazy. You click on configure.
[10:19] You can see what this can do. Now, it
[10:21] can even create documents for you in
[10:22] Canva. It is wild. I'll show you exactly
[10:24] what I mean. But first, let's head back
[10:26] over to co-work and go back to our
[10:27] homepage. So, we're going to come down.
[10:29] We're going to create a new task. So,
[10:30] let's just ask it something about our
[10:32] inbox. Hey dude, what was the last email
[10:34] I had? What is the subject line of that
[10:36] email? And then, what is the next
[10:38] appointment in my calendar? Something
[10:40] like this, right? Bam. So, that one
[10:41] straight off. Very easy question for
[10:42] Club Co to get there. Now, previously it
[10:44] was the case that Gemini, the online
[10:47] model, was the best one for this because
[10:49] it was all naturally integrated, but
[10:50] because it's so easy now to integrate
[10:53] Gmail and Google calendar. This is a
[10:54] complete no-brainer right now using
[10:56] coowork. And there we go. It's found my
[10:58] last email, which was someone's uh
[11:00] downloaded my Gumroad thing. And also,
[11:02] I've got appointment in the gym today,
[11:03] 2:15 p.m. Dubai, uh, which is going to
[11:06] be great. That's happening tomorrow, I
[11:07] think. So, you get just how powerful
[11:09] this is. But what if I wanted to grab
[11:11] something from Canva, but I didn't have
[11:12] time? I could say something like, "Hey
[11:14] dude, I want you to open up my Canva
[11:16] designs. Uh, go to my latest design and
[11:18] download for me the very first page as a
[11:20] PDF and then save that for me on my
[11:22] desktop. I would also like you to edit
[11:24] it beforehand. Add some text in Monat
[11:27] font that says this is great at the
[11:30] bottom in a place that would kind of
[11:31] make sense. In fact, why don't you just
[11:33] re-edit the title of that to say Jack is
[11:35] cool and then download as a PDF."
[11:37] Awesome. Send that one off and then let
[11:39] Claude work her work do the magic in the
[11:41] background. And so look, it's starting.
[11:42] Let me start by finding your latest
[11:43] Canva design. It's having a look, which
[11:45] is crazy. It's pulled everything up.
[11:47] That is nuts. Look at this guys. Here it
[11:48] says page one is currently cla work.
[11:51] I'll now change it to Jack is cool. And
[11:53] you can see it's asking for permission,
[11:54] which we just granted. And I brought it
[11:55] over here just so you can get a great
[11:56] look of it. I'm always conscious about
[11:58] making sure you can see everything
[11:59] that's happening, which is wonderful.
[12:00] And there we go, guys. The text on page
[12:02] one now says Jack is cool. Let's see the
[12:04] image. Uh we're going to open up the
[12:05] link. Take a look. Jack is cool. That is
[12:08] crazy good. That is insane. Yep.
[12:10] download as PDF only do the first page.
[12:13] I mean, this is literally nuts, guys.
[12:15] Like, this is really cool, but it can do
[12:16] this for pretty much anything that we
[12:17] want to online with any services. So,
[12:20] essentially now we're only really
[12:21] limited by our imagination. Then, if I
[12:23] come down to my downloads, you can see
[12:25] I've got Jack is cool. It couldn't put
[12:27] it on the desktop because it was in a
[12:28] browser automation mode, but that was
[12:30] just a silly request anyway. But, we
[12:32] actually have it now. Just went to
[12:33] Canva. It did editing changes in the
[12:36] exact same file that I had and then
[12:37] downloaded for me on my computer all by
[12:40] itself, which is literally crazy. Will
[12:42] say though, one of the kind of things
[12:43] that it does need to get better at is
[12:45] doing it quickly. At the moment, it can
[12:47] be a little bit slow with things, which
[12:49] is why I recommend that you create the
[12:51] task, allow it for the things that
[12:52] you're comfortable with, and just let
[12:53] this run in the background and do as
[12:55] many as you need to, and then you just
[12:57] come back when you're ready to come and
[12:58] get it, and it'll just run for you sort
[13:00] of in the background. But I think the
[13:01] speed is one thing. I hope that they do
[13:03] increase over time. Awesome. So, the
[13:04] next thing we can do is actually connect
[13:05] Claude to our meeting. So, for example,
[13:07] let's say you've got an AI meeting note
[13:09] ticket. Let's say you've got and I know
[13:10] they have these here. Fireflies.
[13:12] Fireflies is the one that I use. You
[13:14] could equally use something like Fathom.
[13:16] They're just as good. I come down here.
[13:18] Let's just log in very quickly. So, this
[13:19] has been authorized, but the general
[13:21] idea here is that these AI meeting not
[13:23] takers join us for every call. And then
[13:24] we have Claude that can reach over and
[13:26] ask it questions based on whatever
[13:28] information that we need. So you never
[13:29] have to second guess what it is you're
[13:31] actually talking about. So that's all
[13:33] authorized. Let's you back over now to
[13:34] Claude. And we're going to open Claude
[13:36] back up. Come over here. Uh let's shut
[13:38] this one down. And I believe that's
[13:39] connected. We can always validate by
[13:41] coming down here to connectors. And we
[13:42] see Fireflies is enabled. So I'll say
[13:44] something like, hey, what was the title
[13:47] of my last meeting? Something like that.
[13:49] So whatever we want to, it could be,
[13:51] hey, what did John say about the net
[13:54] revenue uh 6 months ago? It could be,
[13:56] hey, what was that meeting with 77? But
[13:57] what are my actions from this thing?
[13:59] Now, check. This is where it gets really
[14:01] crazy. Check this out. We're going to
[14:02] allow that to do that. And look at this,
[14:03] guys. Your last meeting was Glider
[14:05] Weekly, which took 56 minutes. But this
[14:07] is where it gets crazy. I'm going to
[14:08] say, "Awesome." I'm going to say, "Grab
[14:11] me my actions and create a new notion
[14:15] doc with those in something like that."
[14:18] Right? So, now we can actually leverage
[14:20] multiple MCPS at the exact same time.
[14:23] So, not only is it now using information
[14:24] to grab my actions, it's then going to
[14:26] go ahead and actually update that in
[14:27] notion. Meaning, you don't even need to
[14:28] touch either of those platforms, it can
[14:30] all be done within Claude Co. Just like
[14:32] that, it says it's done it very, very
[14:34] quickly. Actually, this is very quick.
[14:36] So, let's open up this action. Have a
[14:37] look. Let's click on this and see what
[14:38] it does. So, it's open a new notion
[14:40] link. And just like that, guys, it's
[14:41] actually physically done this for us.
[14:42] It's got all my actions from the
[14:44] meeting, everybody's actions per meeting
[14:46] actually, and put it in notion. Again, I
[14:47] could have actually do anything, but you
[14:49] can see the capabilities now of what we
[14:51] can do with these different connections
[14:52] within Claude Co. And then if I
[14:53] anonymize the information, one of the
[14:55] cool things we can do is highlight this
[14:56] text and be like, "Hey, Glido, add an
[14:59] emoji per bullet point such that if I
[15:01] were to post this into notion, it would
[15:03] look great." And then once we've done
[15:04] that, we can give it the prompt, get the
[15:06] information with the with the actual
[15:07] emojis, cuz guys, we are nothing without
[15:10] our emojis these days. And so now we've
[15:11] mastered the ability to connect Claude
[15:13] code to your world. The next thing we
[15:15] want to do is understand any repetitive
[15:17] task that you do in your business and
[15:19] think about ways that Claude Co-work can
[15:21] actually enshrine these processes into
[15:24] something called a skill. And this skill
[15:26] once we define it and make it incredible
[15:28] is something that Claude Co-work can use
[15:30] whenever you're talking to it in the
[15:32] future. So what I recommend you do at
[15:33] this point is think of anything that you
[15:35] find yourself doing or your team finds
[15:37] itself doing on a regular basis and then
[15:40] turn that into a skill. So why don't we
[15:42] take an example of let's take my YouTube
[15:44] channel for instance, right? What if we
[15:46] took my transcript and then what we did
[15:48] is we turned that into a newsletter in
[15:52] whatever style we want to. So maybe
[15:53] that's something that I know a lot of
[15:54] people do. So why don't we give that as
[15:56] an example? So I might say, hey there, I
[15:58] would like you to follow the blur
[16:00] processes and when you get an outcome
[16:02] that I'm happy with, we're both going to
[16:04] turn this into a skill that you're going
[16:05] to save. So, what I would like you to do
[16:07] is to go over to my latest video or a
[16:09] video URL that I provide to you on the
[16:11] Jack Roberts YouTube channel. I'd like
[16:13] you to grab the transcript and then I
[16:15] want you to turn that into basically a
[16:18] newsletter email. Okay, beautiful. Send
[16:20] that one off. Let it do his work. Then
[16:21] we're going to send it off. And I
[16:22] suggest what we do is we need to think
[16:24] of a few different things separately
[16:26] because typically speaking, the more
[16:28] tasks that we give to an AI, the worse
[16:30] it performs. So, I want we're going to
[16:31] break this down step by step. We're
[16:33] going to do the email title. Then we're
[16:35] going to do probably the first sentence
[16:37] and then we're going to do the the rest
[16:38] of the email on the bottom. Okay,
[16:40] awesome. And then send that one off.
[16:41] Equally, by the way, this could be done
[16:43] with LinkedIn posts. This could be
[16:45] Instagram post. This could include image
[16:47] generation and we could reach over to
[16:48] Canva create documents which I think
[16:50] probably makes good sense. So why don't
[16:52] we as part of this actually include some
[16:55] aspect that would be very very
[16:56] interesting. So then CL's come back and
[16:58] ask a question. We'll say hey just
[16:59] search my latest which is cool. Uh what
[17:01] time? Well, we're about casual and
[17:02] conversational over here on the Jack
[17:04] Roberts YouTube channel. And again,
[17:05] we're looking more entrepreneurs and
[17:06] founders, which is great. And I think
[17:09] medium length would be wonderful. Cool.
[17:10] So, we specified this. We can then go
[17:12] back and forth. We can do anything we
[17:14] want to and even give our own specific
[17:15] tone of voice, which is ace. The cool
[17:17] thing here as well is that we can
[17:19] actually specify where we want
[17:21] information. So, I can trigger Claude to
[17:22] do something and then essentially I can
[17:24] say when it's done, I want this to be
[17:26] live in this Google folder here or
[17:29] create me an email with that and send it
[17:30] to me. So, we get to be specific about
[17:32] how we trigger it, what the actual skill
[17:34] is, and then where the end destination
[17:36] is, meaning that it's just way simpler
[17:37] for you. And this is doing something
[17:39] really interesting. I want to double
[17:40] click on that. So, this isn't finding
[17:42] the transcript on my YouTube page. So,
[17:44] which is completely fine. And it's
[17:45] saying, "Let me use YouTube
[17:46] transanscript.com." So, Claude will use
[17:49] these different services if you want to.
[17:51] There's also another thing you can do,
[17:53] which is use direct API calls. So, check
[17:55] this out. I can hit stop on this and I
[17:57] can be like, "Hey there, dude. I want
[17:59] you to use the YouTube API service to
[18:02] pull the transcript and information
[18:04] whenever I'm asking you to do things
[18:05] like this. Use the below API key. All
[18:07] right, so this can work for any kind of
[18:10] API call that you're doing. I can enter
[18:11] my API key and hit enter. And this is an
[18:13] API key I got from
[18:14] console.cloud.google.com.
[18:17] I appreciate that might be a little bit
[18:18] technical for some people. It's actually
[18:20] dead straightforward. I'll show you how
[18:21] that works if you're interested. And
[18:22] this will work for any YouTube API
[18:24] service. You come over here, click on a
[18:26] new project like so. Give that a second
[18:29] and all of a sudden we call it here
[18:30] we'll call this one hey like so and then
[18:32] click on create. Cool. And this creates
[18:34] a brand new project. And within this
[18:36] project we can create many different uh
[18:37] APIs. Basically the one that we're most
[18:39] interested in if you're YouTube is
[18:41] actually the YouTube API. So once that's
[18:43] done we click on select project which is
[18:45] fine. Then all we do at the top is
[18:48] basically search for things. So I'm
[18:49] going to come down and go for YouTube
[18:50] and it should be YouTube data API v3.
[18:53] Cool. Click on this one. Awesome. Give
[18:55] this a hot second. And even if you don't
[18:56] want to do YouTube, knowing how this
[18:58] works will be very valuable for you. I
[18:59] just click on enable, which is great.
[19:02] Once that's done, we can just add some
[19:03] API keys in and then you're basically
[19:05] ready to rock and roll. Then once that's
[19:07] activated, you come down here to
[19:08] credentials on the left hand side. When
[19:10] that's loaded up, you're going to go for
[19:11] API keys and you're going to click on uh
[19:13] create credentials at the top and create
[19:15] API key. And then once you've clicked
[19:16] create API key, you'll see it there. You
[19:18] copy it and then you can leverage the
[19:19] full YouTube stuff and anything else you
[19:21] want to within Google Cloud. And then
[19:23] when I come back, you can see got it
[19:24] much better approach. Let me use the
[19:25] YouTube API directly. So, this is a cool
[19:27] thing about Glad Coowwork. We can give
[19:28] it API calls that it can do for us
[19:30] dynamically for any of the skills that
[19:32] we give it. Cool. And just like that,
[19:33] we've now got the full transcript,
[19:34] 48,739
[19:36] characters. I did a lot of yapping in
[19:38] that video. So, then it asked us what we
[19:40] want for the title. So, for example, I
[19:41] would say something like, hey, so the
[19:43] rules for the title is it must create
[19:45] curiosity or be something that adds
[19:47] value. We want to keep the title fairly
[19:49] short. Everything needs to be lowercase.
[19:51] And I think in many cases you can just
[19:53] lean on exactly what the YouTube um
[19:55] title actually is. Something like that,
[19:57] right? Boom. Send that off. Again, now
[19:59] we're building up these different rules
[20:00] so it'll work for us autonomously. Let's
[20:02] come back here and just say always
[20:04] capitalize the I again. And even if this
[20:07] was like 99% done, it will be an email
[20:09] ready to rock and roll all the way
[20:10] through. It's asking us through a
[20:11] question about how we want the emails to
[20:13] look. So this is great if you can
[20:15] actually feed Claude examples of your
[20:16] writing style. So it kind of knows
[20:18] exactly how it is that you write. So,
[20:20] I'm going to provide that to it so it
[20:21] knows my kind of style. So, if I come
[20:22] over to the community, I want to get a
[20:23] sense of my writing style. I can come
[20:25] over and grab uh some examples of how I
[20:28] write, right? So, it understands my
[20:29] style, how it feels. Come back over to
[20:32] Claude real quick and just say, "Hey,
[20:33] dude, I'm going to give you some
[20:34] examples of text that I write. And I
[20:36] want you to create a writing style for
[20:38] me based on that." Okay. So, then I'm
[20:40] going to come down and just say example
[20:42] one. Cool. Drop that in. Come back over
[20:44] and then just basically come and grab
[20:46] loads of examples. So then after giving
[20:48] that is asking for some clarific
[20:49] questions. So we could say hey number
[20:51] one sounds great. Just some general
[20:52] notes on how my communication style I
[20:54] want it to be shorter rather than longer
[20:56] personable and I think we want kind of
[20:58] like almost like one sentence and a
[21:00] space and another sentence as we go
[21:01] down. Cool. Then what we're going to say
[21:03] is then write the rest of the email.
[21:04] Keep it medium length. Don't make it too
[21:06] long. Make it valueled. Use emojis where
[21:08] appropriate. Um and then show me an
[21:10] example full draft. Sweet. And then what
[21:12] we can do obviously is just feed it all
[21:14] the examples. It just builds it in your
[21:16] style. And then once that's done, we can
[21:18] then enshrine this into a skill, which
[21:19] means that the next time, for example, I
[21:21] do a video, I can just get it to create
[21:23] for me a wonderful email that I can then
[21:25] send off and integrate with all my
[21:27] services. You can see guys, it's come
[21:28] back with, I think, a really good
[21:30] example of my writing style. So, I've
[21:32] given a bit of information, a bit of
[21:33] feedback about what it should look like,
[21:35] and I've just added a little bit of the
[21:36] CTA if they want to come and join the
[21:38] community, which I'll just provide it
[21:39] very quickly. Uh, let's grab this right
[21:41] here. But again, this is you build it.
[21:43] The idea of this is that you build it
[21:44] once and then once it's built, it's
[21:46] done. Right? So there we go. Send that
[21:48] one off there. And so guys, what I'm
[21:49] going to say now is to turn this into a
[21:51] HTML file so that you and I can use as
[21:54] part of the skill. We can just then copy
[21:55] that, drop it into our email editor and
[21:57] send off to anybody we want to. Then
[21:59] once we get the HTML file, it looks a
[22:00] little bit something like this. But if
[22:01] we don't want HTML, we could say, "Hey
[22:03] dude, I just want it in this plain
[22:04] document, uh, like normal text that I
[22:06] could copy and paste into the body of an
[22:07] email, please." And then just have the
[22:09] title of it above and save that to my
[22:11] computer. So basically, you can pretty
[22:13] much decide exactly how you want the
[22:14] output to be with Claude Co-work. We
[22:16] check this text file out. You can see
[22:17] there's the full email in my own
[22:18] particular tone of voice. But the real
[22:20] magic now happens, guys, when we turn
[22:22] this into a skill. So let's bring this
[22:23] over here and have a little chat with
[22:25] him. Okay, awesome. Based on this entire
[22:27] process of grabbing a YouTube video or
[22:29] being provided with a YouTube URL and
[22:32] then turning it into an email in my own
[22:34] tone of voice and saving it as a text
[22:36] file on my computer, I want you to
[22:38] create a skill using your create a
[22:40] skills skill. Um, so you can do this
[22:42] replicably in the future for me. We send
[22:44] that one off. So again, the idea is that
[22:45] we pick a single process. We then just
[22:47] enshrine that into a skill, meaning that
[22:49] we save time in everything we're doing.
[22:51] And remember, this is a co-work. This is
[22:53] a co-working agent that is in the doing
[22:55] of the thing. Anti-gravity is the
[22:57] building of the software. Anti-gravity
[22:59] is a giant with this stuff. I actually
[23:01] asked anti-gravity to scrap all my
[23:02] transcripts. I gave my API key and it
[23:04] did it within like 45 seconds. It was
[23:07] crazy. The way I want to think of cloud
[23:09] co-work is more as something that's
[23:11] working alongside you in the doing of
[23:13] the things you're doing right now and
[23:14] need to do right now is a real cool
[23:16] cloud co-work use case and it's come
[23:17] back with a suggested flow of how it
[23:19] wants to do everything. It's got the
[23:20] workflow steps which is awesome. Does
[23:21] that look right? You basically summarize
[23:23] over it and you say that looks awesome.
[23:24] Please go ahead and just like that guys
[23:26] we've now got the skills been created.
[23:28] We can see here phase one is find the
[23:29] video pop transcript. Phase two is
[23:31] step-by-step drafting title option,
[23:33] opening lines, full email body. Then
[23:35] stage three is to save as a plain text
[23:37] file that we can then copy and paste.
[23:38] And you can do this with any skill that
[23:40] you would like. So now you understand
[23:42] how to use skills to automate different
[23:44] parts of the business. We can take this
[23:46] now one step further in level five by
[23:48] looking at Claude Co plugins. So in
[23:52] Claude's own words, skills are
[23:54] instruction files that teach Claude how
[23:56] to do a task well. In other words, go to
[23:57] YouTube channel, grab something,
[23:58] download it. Plugins are installable
[24:00] packages that give Claude new
[24:02] capabilities that they can bundle
[24:04] together things like MCP servers just
[24:06] complicated language for how we connect
[24:08] things to different things tools skills
[24:10] into one really key important detail
[24:12] here sharable plug-in file. So for
[24:14] example we've done it now for YouTube we
[24:17] could do one for LinkedIn we could do
[24:19] one for Instagram we could do one for X.
[24:22] Now they would all be five different
[24:23] skills that together come part of one
[24:26] plugin. Now, the best way to understand
[24:28] this is you can create your own plugins
[24:30] if you wanted to. So, I could say, "Hey,
[24:31] do me now a LinkedIn skill. Do me an X
[24:34] skill." Then I could say, "Bundle these
[24:36] five skills together into a plugin. But
[24:38] one of the best ways to understand it is
[24:40] actually to take a look at some of the
[24:42] inbuilt plugins so you can see exactly
[24:44] what I mean." So, if I come down here to
[24:45] the plus, going to come down here, we're
[24:46] going to click on add plugins. And we've
[24:49] got about five or six as default here.
[24:52] buyer research, customer support, triage
[24:54] tickets, draft responses, escalate
[24:56] issues, data, enterprise research, uh
[24:58] finance, legal, marketing, product
[25:01] management, productivity, and sales. So,
[25:03] you can pick anyone you want to. Say,
[25:04] for example, we want to come down to
[25:06] productivity. We're just going to click
[25:07] on install that plug-in. And then you
[25:08] can see you can manage it now in the top
[25:10] right hand side. So, when we load this
[25:11] page up, you can see it's got a list of
[25:13] commands like set up my task and memory
[25:15] system, catch me up on my triage
[25:17] systems, all this sort of stuff, right?
[25:18] But what's really cool is the
[25:19] connectors. So you can see how it's got
[25:21] connections to all of these different
[25:23] product management softwares, right?
[25:24] ClickUp and Monday and Alassian, Asa,
[25:27] notion. So we can bundle all together
[25:29] these different connections like we may
[25:30] want a connection to notion and a
[25:32] connection to Gmail. And you bundle all
[25:34] these things together and then
[25:35] underneath that it's got the skills
[25:37] memory management, task management. So
[25:39] we might have in ours uh LinkedIn
[25:41] content creation, we have email content
[25:43] creation. We can bundle all together
[25:45] these different skills plus all the
[25:47] connectors into the plugin and then we
[25:49] can share that with our team or with our
[25:52] communities. Now, understanding plugins
[25:53] include co-work, but if you don't
[25:56] understand how to leverage anti-gravity,
[25:58] its design systems, its business
[25:59] systems, you're never going to fully
[26:01] leverage the capabilities on offer for
[26:03] your business. And you can learn those
[26:05] by watching this video right
