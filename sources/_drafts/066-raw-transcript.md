This tool crashed the stock market a few This tool crashed the stock market a few weeks ago and it's not a new AI model. weeks ago and it's not a new AI model.

weeks ago and it's not a new AI model. It's a feature inside Claude called It's a feature inside Claude called It's a feature inside Claude called Co-work and I've been testing it on my Co-work and I've been testing it on my Co-work and I've been testing it on my actual business. It's organized my

actual business. It's organized my actual business. It's organized my files, chopped my podcast into shorts, files, chopped my podcast into shorts, files, chopped my podcast into shorts, reviewed my entire email strategy, and reviewed my entire email strategy, and

reviewed my entire email strategy, and then drafted an eight email campaign, then drafted an eight email campaign, then drafted an eight email campaign, posted straight to notion, all while I posted straight to notion, all while I posted straight to notion, all while I made my coffee. So, today I'm going to

made my coffee. So, today I'm going to made my coffee. So, today I'm going to walk you through everything it did. But walk you through everything it did. But walk you through everything it did. But the demo where it analyzed 10 of my the demo where it analyzed 10 of my

the demo where it analyzed 10 of my podcast episodes and found 12 content podcast episodes and found 12 content podcast episodes and found 12 content gaps I'd completely missed. Well, that gaps I'd completely missed. Well, that gaps I'd completely missed. Well, that one genuinely changed how I'm planning

one genuinely changed how I'm planning one genuinely changed how I'm planning my next quarter. So, if you haven't my next quarter. So, if you haven't my next quarter. So, if you haven't heard of Cowwork yet, quick version, heard of Cowwork yet, quick version,

heard of Cowwork yet, quick version, Anthropic, the company behind Claude, Anthropic, the company behind Claude, Anthropic, the company behind Claude, has this tool called Claude Code and has this tool called Claude Code and has this tool called Claude Code and developers are obsessed with it. But

developers are obsessed with it. But developers are obsessed with it. But then non-technical people started using then non-technical people started using then non-technical people started using it too for everything. organizing files, it too for everything. organizing files,

it too for everything. organizing files, planning holidays, managing their entire planning holidays, managing their entire planning holidays, managing their entire businesses. So, Anthropic was like, businesses. So, Anthropic was like, businesses. So, Anthropic was like, "Okay, yeah, let's get Claude Code to

"Okay, yeah, let's get Claude Code to "Okay, yeah, let's get Claude Code to build this for everyone." And that's how build this for everyone." And that's how build this for everyone." And that's how co-work came about. So, it's the same AI co-work came about. So, it's the same AI

co-work came about. So, it's the same AI brain, same power, but you don't need to brain, same power, but you don't need to brain, same power, but you don't need to know what a terminal is. And honestly, know what a terminal is. And honestly, know what a terminal is. And honestly, when I say it crushed the stock market,

when I say it crushed the stock market, when I say it crushed the stock market, I'm not being dramatic. software stocks I'm not being dramatic. software stocks I'm not being dramatic. software stocks dropped billions because investors dropped billions because investors

dropped billions because investors realize this thing can do a lot of what realize this thing can do a lot of what realize this thing can do a lot of what other SAS tools can do for 20 bucks a other SAS tools can do for 20 bucks a other SAS tools can do for 20 bucks a month. And I'm going to show you how to

month. And I'm going to show you how to month. And I'm going to show you how to use it. All right, first up, I'm going use it. All right, first up, I'm going use it. All right, first up, I'm going to quickly run through the difference to quickly run through the difference

to quickly run through the difference between Claude Chat, Claude Cowwork, and between Claude Chat, Claude Cowwork, and between Claude Chat, Claude Cowwork, and Claude Code. And yes, I did make this Claude Code. And yes, I did make this Claude Code. And yes, I did make this interactive artifact using Claude chat.

interactive artifact using Claude chat. interactive artifact using Claude chat. So Claude chat is where a lot of people So Claude chat is where a lot of people So Claude chat is where a lot of people hang out particularly when they first hang out particularly when they first

hang out particularly when they first start using Claude. So that's in the start using Claude. So that's in the start using Claude. So that's in the browser or it could even be in your browser or it could even be in your browser or it could even be in your desktop. This is where you're asking

desktop. This is where you're asking desktop. This is where you're asking questions, you get answer, create questions, you get answer, create questions, you get answer, create content, that sort of thing. And it's content, that sort of thing. And it's

content, that sort of thing. And it's all in the chat window. This is like all in the chat window. This is like all in the chat window. This is like super user friendly and it's just got a super user friendly and it's just got a super user friendly and it's just got a little breakdown here. It's best for

little breakdown here. It's best for little breakdown here. It's best for writing and editing content, writing and editing content, writing and editing content, brainstorming strategy. The limitations brainstorming strategy. The limitations

[2:02]

brainstorming strategy. The limitations here are that it can't access your files here are that it can't access your files here are that it can't access your files directly. It's one response at a time, directly. It's one response at a time, directly. It's one response at a time, copying, pasting, unless you're using

copying, pasting, unless you're using copying, pasting, unless you're using connectors. And then moving over to connectors. And then moving over to connectors. And then moving over to co-work, which is such an upgrade co-work, which is such an upgrade

co-work, which is such an upgrade because it's basically the bridge because it's basically the bridge because it's basically the bridge between claude chat and claude code. So, between claude chat and claude code. So, between claude chat and claude code. So, what's really cool about this is that

what's really cool about this is that what's really cool about this is that you can give it access to your files. It you can give it access to your files. It you can give it access to your files. It can help with organizing and renaming can help with organizing and renaming

can help with organizing and renaming files, creating documents, spreadsheets, files, creating documents, spreadsheets, files, creating documents, spreadsheets, repurposing content across platforms, repurposing content across platforms, repurposing content across platforms, video editing, and batch processing. And

video editing, and batch processing. And video editing, and batch processing. And it's really friendly for non-technical it's really friendly for non-technical it's really friendly for non-technical founders. And then finally, we've got founders. And then finally, we've got

founders. And then finally, we've got Claud code over here. If you want to Claud code over here. If you want to Claud code over here. If you want to build it up, Claude Code, like you can build it up, Claude Code, like you can build it up, Claude Code, like you can just do basically whatever you want with

just do basically whatever you want with just do basically whatever you want with Claude code. That's how I feel about CL Claude code. That's how I feel about CL Claude code. That's how I feel about CL code, but the learning curve for it is a code, but the learning curve for it is a

code, but the learning curve for it is a lot steeper. So, it is great at writing lot steeper. So, it is great at writing lot steeper. So, it is great at writing and debugging code, building entire and debugging code, building entire and debugging code, building entire systems and workflows. There are people

systems and workflows. There are people systems and workflows. There are people out there using it for marketing out there using it for marketing out there using it for marketing content, all sorts of stuff. So, it content, all sorts of stuff. So, it

content, all sorts of stuff. So, it definitely isn't just coding and definitely isn't just coding and definitely isn't just coding and applications. How people who have never applications. How people who have never applications. How people who have never opened a terminal, it is really kind of

opened a terminal, it is really kind of opened a terminal, it is really kind of intimidating. So, code, as I said intimidating. So, code, as I said intimidating. So, code, as I said before, bridges that gap. So, here's a before, bridges that gap. So, here's a

before, bridges that gap. So, here's a nice breakdown. I'll actually drop this nice breakdown. I'll actually drop this nice breakdown. I'll actually drop this into the YouTube description, too, cuz into the YouTube description, too, cuz into the YouTube description, too, cuz this gives a really nice visual

this gives a really nice visual this gives a really nice visual breakdown of what each of these can and breakdown of what each of these can and breakdown of what each of these can and can't do and some features. All right, can't do and some features. All right,

can't do and some features. All right, so let's open co-work in our desktop so let's open co-work in our desktop so let's open co-work in our desktop app. This is our Claude chat window. And app. This is our Claude chat window. And app. This is our Claude chat window. And in the desktop app, access now if you're

in the desktop app, access now if you're in the desktop app, access now if you're on a Mac to co-work as well as Claude on a Mac to co-work as well as Claude on a Mac to co-work as well as Claude code. Jumping over here, just a few code. Jumping over here, just a few

code. Jumping over here, just a few things. So model pickers here, extended things. So model pickers here, extended things. So model pickers here, extended thinking, we've got access to Sonnet thinking, we've got access to Sonnet thinking, we've got access to Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5, as well as Opus 4.6.

4.5, Haiku 4.5, as well as Opus 4.6. 4.5, Haiku 4.5, as well as Opus 4.6. This is one of the key features, right? This is one of the key features, right?

This is one of the key features, right? We can now interact with Claude co-work We can now interact with Claude co-work We can now interact with Claude co-work in our folders. So I'm going to give in our folders. So I'm going to give in our folders. So I'm going to give this one access to my downloads. So the

[4:05]

this one access to my downloads. So the this one access to my downloads. So the first thing I'm going to show you how to first thing I'm going to show you how to first thing I'm going to show you how to do is clean up your downloads folder.

do is clean up your downloads folder. do is clean up your downloads folder. When co-work first dropped, that was the When co-work first dropped, that was the When co-work first dropped, that was the very first thing I got it to do. It's very first thing I got it to do. It's

very first thing I got it to do. It's been like 3 weeks and my downloads needs been like 3 weeks and my downloads needs been like 3 weeks and my downloads needs another cleaner. So, let's get it to do another cleaner. So, let's get it to do another cleaner. So, let's get it to do that today. Can you please sort my

that today. Can you please sort my that today. Can you please sort my downloads folder out for me? And then downloads folder out for me? And then downloads folder out for me? And then you can see over here. So, it's starting you can see over here. So, it's starting

you can see over here. So, it's starting up this task. It will create a to-do up this task. It will create a to-do up this task. It will create a to-do list over here where it kind of plans list over here where it kind of plans list over here where it kind of plans out what it's going to do and then works

out what it's going to do and then works out what it's going to do and then works off that to-do list here. Folders and off that to-do list here. Folders and off that to-do list here. Folders and files that it has access to and then any files that it has access to and then any

files that it has access to and then any context here. So if you're working on context here. So if you're working on context here. So if you're working on maybe a marketing activity, you could maybe a marketing activity, you could maybe a marketing activity, you could have brand voice guide, content pillars,

have brand voice guide, content pillars, have brand voice guide, content pillars, all of that sort of stuff in that all of that sort of stuff in that all of that sort of stuff in that context here. All right. So it's context here. All right. So it's

context here. All right. So it's accessed my downloads here and it's got accessed my downloads here and it's got accessed my downloads here and it's got 69 loose files that it needs to clean 69 loose files that it needs to clean 69 loose files that it needs to clean out. All right. And then the really cool

out. All right. And then the really cool out. All right. And then the really cool thing about this is before it starts to thing about this is before it starts to thing about this is before it starts to do anything, it asks you questions. So do anything, it asks you questions. So

do anything, it asks you questions. So it asks you questions here about what it it asks you questions here about what it it asks you questions here about what it is going to do for you. And this is kind is going to do for you. And this is kind is going to do for you. And this is kind of like plan mode in claude code if you

of like plan mode in claude code if you of like plan mode in claude code if you are familiar with that. If you're not, are familiar with that. If you're not, are familiar with that. If you're not, it's all good. So how would you like me it's all good. So how would you like me

it's all good. So how would you like me to sort the loose files into the to sort the loose files into the to sort the loose files into the existing folders into a stated subfolder existing folders into a stated subfolder existing folders into a stated subfolder or just by file type? So the first time

or just by file type? So the first time or just by file type? So the first time Claude Co-work did this, it made these Claude Co-work did this, it made these Claude Co-work did this, it made these beautiful folder system for me. So we're beautiful folder system for me. So we're

beautiful folder system for me. So we're just going to do that. All right. just going to do that. All right. just going to do that. All right. There's an incomplete download. And so There's an incomplete download. And so There's an incomplete download. And so one thing I've done here is as a safety

one thing I've done here is as a safety one thing I've done here is as a safety feature, I have it set up so it's not to feature, I have it set up so it's not to feature, I have it set up so it's not to delete any files, what it does is delete any files, what it does is

delete any files, what it does is reviews them and then puts them into a reviews them and then puts them into a reviews them and then puts them into a folder that is for me to review for folder that is for me to review for folder that is for me to review for deletion because I don't want it to

deletion because I don't want it to deletion because I don't want it to accidentally delete a whole bunch of accidentally delete a whole bunch of accidentally delete a whole bunch of stuff that I do not want it to delete.

stuff that I do not want it to delete. stuff that I do not want it to delete. So that's how I'm getting it to kind of So that's how I'm getting it to kind of So that's how I'm getting it to kind of look at stuff, duplicates, that sort of look at stuff, duplicates, that sort of

look at stuff, duplicates, that sort of thing. But I'm like, "Hey, just put thing. But I'm like, "Hey, just put thing. But I'm like, "Hey, just put those into a folder. I'll review them those into a folder. I'll review them those into a folder. I'll review them and then manually delete." So, you can

and then manually delete." So, you can and then manually delete." So, you can see here in this progress bar, it has see here in this progress bar, it has see here in this progress bar, it has created a to-do list that it's now created a to-do list that it's now

[6:06]

created a to-do list that it's now working through. Sweet. So, it's all working through. Sweet. So, it's all working through. Sweet. So, it's all done here. If we see this now, all of done here. If we see this now, all of done here. If we see this now, all of that progress has been ticked off. It's

that progress has been ticked off. It's that progress has been ticked off. It's given me a breakdown of all of the files given me a breakdown of all of the files given me a breakdown of all of the files that it has moved. Amazing. So, that's that it has moved. Amazing. So, that's

that it has moved. Amazing. So, that's just one tiny way that co-work can help just one tiny way that co-work can help just one tiny way that co-work can help you organizing, renaming files, that you organizing, renaming files, that you organizing, renaming files, that sort of thing. Let's get into one of my

sort of thing. Let's get into one of my sort of thing. Let's get into one of my favorite ways to use. So, if we jump favorite ways to use. So, if we jump favorite ways to use. So, if we jump back over here, you can see all these back over here, you can see all these

back over here, you can see all these tasks that I have completed previously. tasks that I have completed previously. tasks that I have completed previously. And if you want to start a new task, you And if you want to start a new task, you And if you want to start a new task, you just go up here. The cool thing about

just go up here. The cool thing about just go up here. The cool thing about co-work is that you can run tasks in co-work is that you can run tasks in co-work is that you can run tasks in parallel. So, you can have a bunch of parallel. So, you can have a bunch of

parallel. So, you can have a bunch of stuff going at once. It can be working stuff going at once. It can be working stuff going at once. It can be working on that stuff while you're working on on that stuff while you're working on on that stuff while you're working on something else and come back and that's

something else and come back and that's something else and come back and that's all ready and waiting for you. Another all ready and waiting for you. Another all ready and waiting for you. Another cool way to use co-work kind of cool way to use co-work kind of

cool way to use co-work kind of capitalizing on the fact that it can capitalizing on the fact that it can capitalizing on the fact that it can access your folders is to get it to cut access your folders is to get it to cut access your folders is to get it to cut your long form down into short form

your long form down into short form your long form down into short form clips. So I posted about this on threads clips. So I posted about this on threads clips. So I posted about this on threads the other day and the thread went off.

the other day and the thread went off. the other day and the thread went off. It got like 30,000 views and I had It got like 30,000 views and I had It got like 30,000 views and I had people who were like, "Oh my god, this people who were like, "Oh my god, this

people who were like, "Oh my god, this is amazing." And then I had other people is amazing." And then I had other people is amazing." And then I had other people who were like, "You didn't. It didn't do who were like, "You didn't. It didn't do who were like, "You didn't. It didn't do that." So anyways, I dropped one of the

that." So anyways, I dropped one of the that." So anyways, I dropped one of the short form clips where I walked through short form clips where I walked through short form clips where I walked through this and they were like, I stand this and they were like, I stand

this and they were like, I stand corrected. So this is one that if you, corrected. So this is one that if you, corrected. So this is one that if you, you know, you have podcast, YouTube, you know, you have podcast, YouTube, you know, you have podcast, YouTube, that sort of thing, and you want to Tik

that sort of thing, and you want to Tik that sort of thing, and you want to Tik Tok, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, X, Tok, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, X, Tok, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, X, whatever, this is amazing. And I'm just whatever, this is amazing. And I'm just

whatever, this is amazing. And I'm just going to walk you through exactly what I going to walk you through exactly what I going to walk you through exactly what I did. So I just asked it. I was like, are did. So I just asked it. I was like, are did. So I just asked it. I was like, are you able to edit videos? And Claude came

you able to edit videos? And Claude came you able to edit videos? And Claude came back and was like, I can do trimming, back and was like, I can do trimming, back and was like, I can do trimming, create simple animations. I was like, create simple animations. I was like,

create simple animations. I was like, can you pull out byte-size clips from my can you pull out byte-size clips from my can you pull out byte-size clips from my podcast for socials? And so basically podcast for socials? And so basically podcast for socials? And so basically what I gave it access to was the video

what I gave it access to was the video what I gave it access to was the video that I wanted clipped. And so it was that I wanted clipped. And so it was that I wanted clipped. And so it was like, okay, this is like a 22minute like, okay, this is like a 22minute

like, okay, this is like a 22minute video. And what it tried to do first was video. And what it tried to do first was video. And what it tried to do first was transcribe it itself. Because it's a raw transcribe it itself. Because it's a raw transcribe it itself. Because it's a raw video, it was having trouble to do that.

[8:13]

video, it was having trouble to do that. video, it was having trouble to do that. I'm sure there's skills out there that I'm sure there's skills out there that I'm sure there's skills out there that could do that. If you had this on could do that. If you had this on

could do that. If you had this on YouTube, you would be able to grab that YouTube, you would be able to grab that YouTube, you would be able to grab that link and just transcribe it for you.

link and just transcribe it for you. link and just transcribe it for you. I'll give you the video transcript and I'll give you the video transcript and I'll give you the video transcript and then you can kind of look at in that then you can kind of look at in that

then you can kind of look at in that transcript what are five amazing clips transcript what are five amazing clips transcript what are five amazing clips that we could pull out with the key that we could pull out with the key that we could pull out with the key points. And then it was like here's five

points. And then it was like here's five points. And then it was like here's five key points and it was like I'll create key points and it was like I'll create key points and it was like I'll create five vertical clips in 9 to6 ratio for five vertical clips in 9 to6 ratio for

five vertical clips in 9 to6 ratio for Tik Tok and reals. And so you can see Tik Tok and reals. And so you can see Tik Tok and reals. And so you can see here it's like that high energy intro here it's like that high energy intro here it's like that high energy intro and these are the key energy points that

and these are the key energy points that and these are the key energy points that I was like these are worth clipping. So I was like these are worth clipping. So I was like these are worth clipping. So I dropped the transcript down and then I dropped the transcript down and then

I dropped the transcript down and then here they are. Slop is killing your here they are. Slop is killing your here they are. Slop is killing your brand. Lazy AI will damage your brand.

brand. Lazy AI will damage your brand. brand. Lazy AI will damage your brand. Agency A versus agency B. AI is a Agency A versus agency B. AI is a Agency A versus agency B. AI is a mirror. And then AI is not a mirror. And then AI is not a

mirror. And then AI is not a replacement. It's an amplification. So replacement. It's an amplification. So replacement. It's an amplification. So and it I love this. It's pulled out why and it I love this. It's pulled out why and it I love this. It's pulled out why it works and a quote here too. So then

it works and a quote here too. So then it works and a quote here too. So then it's just gone and cut these clips. And it's just gone and cut these clips. And it's just gone and cut these clips. And if I open these for you, you will see if I open these for you, you will see

if I open these for you, you will see what these. And this is really cool too. what these. And this is really cool too. what these. And this is really cool too. I love this about co-work once it's I love this about co-work once it's I love this about co-work once it's completed something, it will give you

completed something, it will give you completed something, it will give you this summary of what it's done. So it's this summary of what it's done. So it's this summary of what it's done. So it's named these which is meaningful. The AI named these which is meaningful. The AI

named these which is meaningful. The AI slop is killing your brand. Lazy AI slop is killing your brand. Lazy AI slop is killing your brand. Lazy AI damages your brand. That sort of thing.

damages your brand. That sort of thing. damages your brand. That sort of thing. So I know if I'm in that folder, I'm So I know if I'm in that folder, I'm So I know if I'm in that folder, I'm just like, "Oh yeah, that one." And it's just like, "Oh yeah, that one." And it's

just like, "Oh yeah, that one." And it's got the length of them here. And it also got the length of them here. And it also got the length of them here. And it also created captions and calls to actions.

created captions and calls to actions. created captions and calls to actions. So let's open this now. And because I So let's open this now. And because I So let's open this now. And because I did that file clean, I'm just going to did that file clean, I'm just going to

did that file clean, I'm just going to have to open it manually. And then you have to open it manually. And then you have to open it manually. And then you can see here it has created these can see here it has created these can see here it has created these captions, hashtags, and also it has put

captions, hashtags, and also it has put captions, hashtags, and also it has put that is my many chat automation word so that is my many chat automation word so that is my many chat automation word so that people get sent the podcast. So that people get sent the podcast. So

that people get sent the podcast. So good. And then what I love too is it has good. And then what I love too is it has good. And then what I love too is it has so they're ready to go. And then it's so they're ready to go. And then it's so they're ready to go. And then it's given me these posting strategy tips as

given me these posting strategy tips as given me these posting strategy tips as well. Best times for my audience and the well. Best times for my audience and the well. Best times for my audience and the hashtags notes as well. So useful. All hashtags notes as well. So useful. All

hashtags notes as well. So useful. All right, I'm going to show you a couple right, I'm going to show you a couple right, I'm going to show you a couple more which are creative and just ways more which are creative and just ways more which are creative and just ways that you probably haven't seen Claude

[10:18]

that you probably haven't seen Claude that you probably haven't seen Claude co-work be used. All right, so co-work be used. All right, so co-work be used. All right, so continuing on with the podcast. So you continuing on with the podcast. So you

continuing on with the podcast. So you can see here these are all connectors, can see here these are all connectors, can see here these are all connectors, right? These we want it working in the right? These we want it working in the right? These we want it working in the tools that we are using. This is where

tools that we are using. This is where tools that we are using. This is where you actually get leverage with AI. So, you actually get leverage with AI. So, you actually get leverage with AI. So, I've got all these connectors here, I've got all these connectors here,

I've got all these connectors here, Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Gamma. So, I Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Gamma. So, I Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Gamma. So, I record all of my podcasts and they sit record all of my podcasts and they sit record all of my podcasts and they sit in a Google Drive in my Fathom

in a Google Drive in my Fathom in a Google Drive in my Fathom Transcripts and analyze the past, let's Transcripts and analyze the past, let's Transcripts and analyze the past, let's say, four episodes. No, let's go 10 say, four episodes. No, let's go 10

say, four episodes. No, let's go 10 episodes and be like, what themes am I episodes and be like, what themes am I episodes and be like, what themes am I repeating? What are some angles that I repeating? What are some angles that I repeating? What are some angles that I haven't hit before? So, let's do that.

haven't hit before? So, let's do that. haven't hit before? So, let's do that. Can you go into my Google Drive Fathom Can you go into my Google Drive Fathom Can you go into my Google Drive Fathom folder and find the last 10 transcripts folder and find the last 10 transcripts

folder and find the last 10 transcripts titled podcast? What I want you to do is titled podcast? What I want you to do is titled podcast? What I want you to do is analyze my podcast themes and episodes analyze my podcast themes and episodes analyze my podcast themes and episodes and give me an idea of repeated themes,

and give me an idea of repeated themes, and give me an idea of repeated themes, any angles that I've missed and some any angles that I've missed and some any angles that I've missed and some ideas for some new episodes and some ideas for some new episodes and some
