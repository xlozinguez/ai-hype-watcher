[0:00]

Hey, what's up everybody? Jeremiah here. Hey, what's up everybody? Jeremiah here. I want to talk about OpenClaw or as it I want to talk about OpenClaw or as it I want to talk about OpenClaw or as it was called Moltbot a couple weeks ago or was called Moltbot a couple weeks ago or

was called Moltbot a couple weeks ago or as it was called Claudebot. What is as it was called Claudebot. What is as it was called Claudebot. What is this? Why is it important? And what has this? Why is it important? And what has this? Why is it important? And what has changed in the world of AI and agents?

changed in the world of AI and agents? changed in the world of AI and agents? I'm telling you this, everything is I'm telling you this, everything is I'm telling you this, everything is progressing faster than we all could progressing faster than we all could

progressing faster than we all could have imagined when it comes to AI agents have imagined when it comes to AI agents have imagined when it comes to AI agents getting things going and what they can getting things going and what they can getting things going and what they can do for us. The difference maker with

do for us. The difference maker with do for us. The difference maker with OpenClaw is that it can literally take OpenClaw is that it can literally take OpenClaw is that it can literally take control of your computer and other control of your computer and other

control of your computer and other computers if you give it access to I computers if you give it access to I computers if you give it access to I literally have it on my network here in literally have it on my network here in literally have it on my network here in my house being able to access my Windows

my house being able to access my Windows my house being able to access my Windows computer, my MacBook. Um, and it just computer, my MacBook. Um, and it just computer, my MacBook. Um, and it just logs in through its own command line to logs in through its own command line to

logs in through its own command line to be able to do stuff on multiple be able to do stuff on multiple be able to do stuff on multiple machines. I can set up multiple other machines. I can set up multiple other machines. I can set up multiple other bots and agents. I have 14 agents right

bots and agents. I have 14 agents right bots and agents. I have 14 agents right now that are working for me. They're now that are working for me. They're now that are working for me. They're building a teleaalth company for my my building a teleaalth company for my my

building a teleaalth company for my my client Sandy Kowski. They're building a client Sandy Kowski. They're building a client Sandy Kowski. They're building a couple businesses for myself and some couple businesses for myself and some couple businesses for myself and some ideas and they're creating content for

tell you this. Anybody could set up an open claw. And I'm going to show you on open claw. And I'm going to show you on open claw. And I'm going to show you on this video how you can set one up this video how you can set one up this video how you can set one up yourself and and how it works. Um, but

yourself and and how it works. Um, but yourself and and how it works. Um, but if you want me to kind of create one for if you want me to kind of create one for if you want me to kind of create one for you that is trained and set up for you.

you that is trained and set up for you. you that is trained and set up for you. You can join the weight list here. You You can join the weight list here. You You can join the weight list here. You can also send me a DM and you could skip can also send me a DM and you could skip

[2:03]

can also send me a DM and you could skip the line uh to be able to do something the line uh to be able to do something the line uh to be able to do something like that by sending me a DM on online.

like that by sending me a DM on online. like that by sending me a DM on online. And I had a lady send me a message about And I had a lady send me a message about And I had a lady send me a message about setting up something in an office uh I setting up something in an office uh I

setting up something in an office uh I thought was pretty cool about doing thought was pretty cool about doing thought was pretty cool about doing something like that for her team. I've something like that for her team. I've something like that for her team. I've already set a couple up for different

already set a couple up for different already set a couple up for different clients as well already. So what is clients as well already. So what is clients as well already. So what is OpenClaw? Again, it's an AI agent. It's OpenClaw? Again, it's an AI agent. It's

OpenClaw? Again, it's an AI agent. It's based on any algorithm of AI that you based on any algorithm of AI that you based on any algorithm of AI that you can use. Uh Anthropics Claude, I use can use. Uh Anthropics Claude, I use can use. Uh Anthropics Claude, I use Claude because I think it's really one

Claude because I think it's really one Claude because I think it's really one of the best that's out there for this of the best that's out there for this of the best that's out there for this Claude Opus 4.6.

Claude Opus 4.6. Claude Opus 4.6. And it takes the traditional chatbot And it takes the traditional chatbot And it takes the traditional chatbot version of AI and it turns it on its version of AI and it turns it on its

version of AI and it turns it on its head where it literally head where it literally head where it literally is able to do stuff. It has an unlimited is able to do stuff. It has an unlimited is able to do stuff. It has an unlimited memory. That's the huge part about it.

memory. That's the huge part about it. memory. That's the huge part about it. It remembers everything and it can log It remembers everything and it can log It remembers everything and it can log into things if you give it access. It into things if you give it access. It

into things if you give it access. It can literally do anything that a person can literally do anything that a person can literally do anything that a person could do, a human being can do at a could do, a human being can do at a could do, a human being can do at a computer besides say record video like

computer besides say record video like computer besides say record video like this. It's also not that great at say this. It's also not that great at say this. It's also not that great at say editing video. One of my clients had editing video. One of my clients had

editing video. One of my clients had asked me that. But besides that, for asked me that. But besides that, for asked me that. But besides that, for most of the stuff that I'm doing in my most of the stuff that I'm doing in my most of the stuff that I'm doing in my business, I created an agent that can

business, I created an agent that can business, I created an agent that can write emails for one of my clients. We write emails for one of my clients. We write emails for one of my clients. We trained it on all of their content, all trained it on all of their content, all

trained it on all of their content, all of the emails they've ever written, and of the emails they've ever written, and of the emails they've ever written, and then had it inspect their social media then had it inspect their social media then had it inspect their social media because they make daily social media

because they make daily social media because they make daily social media content every single day to create content every single day to create content every single day to create emails every week that I can then emails every week that I can then

emails every week that I can then review, choose which ones are great, and review, choose which ones are great, and review, choose which ones are great, and then send it to the client to see in then send it to the client to see in then send it to the client to see in under 10 minutes, which is incredible.

under 10 minutes, which is incredible. under 10 minutes, which is incredible. The quality of the output is above and The quality of the output is above and The quality of the output is above and beyond anything that I've ever seen.

beyond anything that I've ever seen. beyond anything that I've ever seen. Why? Because you're able to feed it so Why? Because you're able to feed it so Why? Because you're able to feed it so much information. It's able to remember much information. It's able to remember

much information. It's able to remember workflows. And it's able to do complex workflows. And it's able to do complex workflows. And it's able to do complex long form tasks. It can work for hours long form tasks. It can work for hours long form tasks. It can work for hours on end to be able to produce an output

on end to be able to produce an output on end to be able to produce an output of some kind that we're looking for. And of some kind that we're looking for. And of some kind that we're looking for. And so this is just it's incredible how this so this is just it's incredible how this

so this is just it's incredible how this works. Here's the recommendation when works. Here's the recommendation when works. Here's the recommendation when using open claw. And I'm going to show using open claw. And I'm going to show using open claw. And I'm going to show you how do I use my open claw. Well, I'm

you how do I use my open claw. Well, I'm you how do I use my open claw. Well, I'm going to show you an example right here. going to show you an example right here.

going to show you an example right here. I have a Slack account set up right I have a Slack account set up right I have a Slack account set up right here. And in my Slack account, I have here. And in my Slack account, I have here. And in my Slack account, I have multiple channels with different

[4:05]

multiple channels with different multiple channels with different OpenClaw agents that I talk to. And OpenClaw agents that I talk to. And OpenClaw agents that I talk to. And there I even have sub agents on other there I even have sub agents on other

there I even have sub agents on other machines and things like that. Uh, one machines and things like that. Uh, one machines and things like that. Uh, one other thing that I'm able to do, I'm other thing that I'm able to do, I'm other thing that I'm able to do, I'm able to remote access in to my openclaw

able to remote access in to my openclaw able to remote access in to my openclaw machine that I have right here. I'm able machine that I have right here. I'm able machine that I have right here. I'm able to actually remote into it using um a to actually remote into it using um a

to actually remote into it using um a tool called Jump Desktop. Let me show tool called Jump Desktop. Let me show tool called Jump Desktop. Let me show you this. I'm going to pull this up on you this. I'm going to pull this up on you this. I'm going to pull this up on the screen here. So, this is the Mac

the screen here. So, this is the Mac the screen here. So, this is the Mac that it's actually running on right that it's actually running on right that it's actually running on right here. But I'm on my Windows computer here. But I'm on my Windows computer

here. But I'm on my Windows computer right now. And this is a remote desktop right now. And this is a remote desktop right now. And this is a remote desktop version of that Mac I can take a look at version of that Mac I can take a look at version of that Mac I can take a look at and I can see all the different stuff

and I can see all the different stuff and I can see all the different stuff that we're doing. And I can access it as that we're doing. And I can access it as that we're doing. And I can access it as if I'm on it right now, which is really if I'm on it right now, which is really

if I'm on it right now, which is really cool. And by the way, that's one of the cool. And by the way, that's one of the cool. And by the way, that's one of the things that I want to be able to set up things that I want to be able to set up things that I want to be able to set up for people to be able to do with this

for people to be able to do with this for people to be able to do with this type of agent hosting. You'll be able to type of agent hosting. You'll be able to type of agent hosting. You'll be able to log in either with a Linux machine or log in either with a Linux machine or

log in either with a Linux machine or the luxury version right here actually the luxury version right here actually the luxury version right here actually is a full Mac experience that gives you is a full Mac experience that gives you is a full Mac experience that gives you the ability to have that full Mac

the ability to have that full Mac the ability to have that full Mac experience which is awesome plus white experience which is awesome plus white experience which is awesome plus white glove support right here by having this glove support right here by having this

glove support right here by having this concierge level which is really cool and concierge level which is really cool and concierge level which is really cool and I want to offer that to people. You get I want to offer that to people. You get I want to offer that to people. You get remote desktop access there um on that

remote desktop access there um on that remote desktop access there um on that level too. But that's what I'm able to level too. But that's what I'm able to level too. But that's what I'm able to do is I'm able to log in remote desktop do is I'm able to log in remote desktop

do is I'm able to log in remote desktop with my agents if I need to do anything with my agents if I need to do anything with my agents if I need to do anything on the computer. But most of the time I on the computer. But most of the time I on the computer. But most of the time I can communicate with them through Slack.

can communicate with them through Slack. can communicate with them through Slack. So I have Slack right here. We're So I have Slack right here. We're So I have Slack right here. We're working on a project. Um we're working working on a project. Um we're working

working on a project. Um we're working on a on a couple of different projects on a on a couple of different projects on a on a couple of different projects right here, which is awesome. And so I right here, which is awesome. And so I right here, which is awesome. And so I can access Slack from my cell phone as

can access Slack from my cell phone as can access Slack from my cell phone as well. I have the Slack app right here on well. I have the Slack app right here on well. I have the Slack app right here on my phone. I can communicate with my my phone. I can communicate with my

my phone. I can communicate with my agents right here. I can I have uh the agents right here. I can I have uh the agents right here. I can I have uh the remote desktop on my phone, all of that.

remote desktop on my phone, all of that. remote desktop on my phone, all of that. So, the idea is I'm able to access this So, the idea is I'm able to access this So, the idea is I'm able to access this any way that I want to um on my desk any way that I want to um on my desk

any way that I want to um on my desk physically. I actually have a Mac Mini physically. I actually have a Mac Mini physically. I actually have a Mac Mini that I picked up off of eBay. So, I that I picked up off of eBay. So, I that I picked up off of eBay. So, I didn't buy a new Mac Mini. I actually

didn't buy a new Mac Mini. I actually didn't buy a new Mac Mini. I actually went over to eBay. This is this is the went over to eBay. This is this is the went over to eBay. This is this is the process that I did, and I think this is process that I did, and I think this is

process that I did, and I think this is probably one of the one of the better probably one of the one of the better probably one of the one of the better processes. I bought a M1 Mac Mini, which processes. I bought a M1 Mac Mini, which processes. I bought a M1 Mac Mini, which is about 6 years old. Um, it's the M1

[6:05]

is about 6 years old. Um, it's the M1 is about 6 years old. Um, it's the M1 processor. You can get it for under processor. You can get it for under processor. You can get it for under $300. An M1 Mac Mini. They're a little $300. An M1 Mac Mini. They're a little

$300. An M1 Mac Mini. They're a little bit larger, but they work great for bit larger, but they work great for bit larger, but they work great for doing these OpenClaw agents, which is doing these OpenClaw agents, which is doing these OpenClaw agents, which is awesome. So, you don't need a brand new

awesome. So, you don't need a brand new awesome. So, you don't need a brand new Mac Mini. You can I would just say at Mac Mini. You can I would just say at Mac Mini. You can I would just say at least get an M1 processor. That's why I least get an M1 processor. That's why I

least get an M1 processor. That's why I looked up M1 Mac Mini. That's one of the looked up M1 Mac Mini. That's one of the looked up M1 Mac Mini. That's one of the best ways to do it. You could also get best ways to do it. You could also get best ways to do it. You could also get uh an 8 gigabyte Raspberry Pi 5, which

uh an 8 gigabyte Raspberry Pi 5, which uh an 8 gigabyte Raspberry Pi 5, which is right here. And that'll cost you is right here. And that'll cost you is right here. And that'll cost you about $150. You can get a full system about $150. You can get a full system

about $150. You can get a full system and enclosure on Amazon as well to run and enclosure on Amazon as well to run and enclosure on Amazon as well to run either a Linux or Windows machine right either a Linux or Windows machine right either a Linux or Windows machine right here. Raspberry Pi is right here. This

here. Raspberry Pi is right here. This here. Raspberry Pi is right here. This is a whole kit that has storage and 8 is a whole kit that has storage and 8 is a whole kit that has storage and 8 gigs of RAM, and it's in a little box gigs of RAM, and it's in a little box

gigs of RAM, and it's in a little box right here with USB and all that. So, right here with USB and all that. So, right here with USB and all that. So, you could also run your agents on one of you could also run your agents on one of you could also run your agents on one of these machines as well. Uh, this doesn't

these machines as well. Uh, this doesn't these machines as well. Uh, this doesn't look like it has a storage one though. look like it has a storage one though.

look like it has a storage one though. That's the only issue. You want at least That's the only issue. You want at least That's the only issue. You want at least 8 gigs of RAM to run these. It's a 8 gigs of RAM to run these. It's a 8 gigs of RAM to run these. It's a little bit difficult to run them on just

little bit difficult to run them on just little bit difficult to run them on just 4 gigs of RAM. So, keep that in mind, 4 gigs of RAM. So, keep that in mind, 4 gigs of RAM. So, keep that in mind, especially with browsers and things like especially with browsers and things like

especially with browsers and things like that. Here's one 179. So, you can either that. Here's one 179. So, you can either that. Here's one 179. So, you can either order this off of Amazon, something like order this off of Amazon, something like order this off of Amazon, something like this, one of these kits, get get this

this, one of these kits, get get this this, one of these kits, get get this set up on an 8 gig. They also sell a 16 set up on an 8 gig. They also sell a 16 set up on an 8 gig. They also sell a 16 gig model. This actually would work gig model. This actually would work

gig model. This actually would work great. Uh, but I think the easiest, best great. Uh, but I think the easiest, best great. Uh, but I think the easiest, best experience is still going to come from experience is still going to come from experience is still going to come from using a Mac. And so that's why I like

using a Mac. And so that's why I like using a Mac. And so that's why I like the Mac Mini. I like that. I also I was the Mac Mini. I like that. I also I was the Mac Mini. I like that. I also I was running it for a couple weeks on my running it for a couple weeks on my

running it for a couple weeks on my MacBook Air. Now I have them off of my MacBook Air. Now I have them off of my MacBook Air. Now I have them off of my MacBook Air and I have this back now MacBook Air and I have this back now MacBook Air and I have this back now that I can use. The MacBook Air was just

that I can use. The MacBook Air was just that I can use. The MacBook Air was just running 24/7. The Mac Mini is over here running 24/7. The Mac Mini is over here running 24/7. The Mac Mini is over here on my desk. By the way, sorry my desk is on my desk. By the way, sorry my desk is

on my desk. By the way, sorry my desk is a little bit messy, but it's right here. a little bit messy, but it's right here. a little bit messy, but it's right here. This is the Mac Mini sitting right here This is the Mac Mini sitting right here This is the Mac Mini sitting right here on my desk and it just sits there. it's

on my desk and it just sits there. it's on my desk and it just sits there. it's on 24/7 uh to be able to access these on 24/7 uh to be able to access these on 24/7 uh to be able to access these agents, which is so so cool. Okay, I agents, which is so so cool. Okay, I

agents, which is so so cool. Okay, I also have a couple of agents in the also have a couple of agents in the also have a couple of agents in the cloud as well. Um I was able to get some cloud as well. Um I was able to get some cloud as well. Um I was able to get some cloud storage from a from a a server

cloud storage from a from a a server cloud storage from a from a a server site called Hzner right here. Um and I site called Hzner right here. Um and I site called Hzner right here. Um and I what I did was I actually had my agents what I did was I actually had my agents

[8:05]

what I did was I actually had my agents research what the best way to set up a research what the best way to set up a research what the best way to set up a VPS uh agent in the cloud was. And it it VPS uh agent in the cloud was. And it it VPS uh agent in the cloud was. And it it showed me how to create an account right

showed me how to create an account right showed me how to create an account right here with Hner. And then it went and set here with Hner. And then it went and set here with Hner. And then it went and set up multiple agents for me using um some up multiple agents for me using um some

up multiple agents for me using um some cloud uh basis storage. Basically cost cloud uh basis storage. Basically cost cloud uh basis storage. Basically cost me like 10 bucks a month and I can have me like 10 bucks a month and I can have me like 10 bucks a month and I can have three or four agents on each cloud

three or four agents on each cloud three or four agents on each cloud instance. Okay, so those are some instance. Okay, so those are some instance. Okay, so those are some different ways to do that if you want to different ways to do that if you want to

different ways to do that if you want to set it up all yourself and do those set it up all yourself and do those set it up all yourself and do those different types of things. Again, I different types of things. Again, I different types of things. Again, I think Mac Mini is good. You don't want

think Mac Mini is good. You don't want think Mac Mini is good. You don't want it on your main machine. it on your main machine.

it on your main machine. You don't want to run it on your main You don't want to run it on your main You don't want to run it on your main machine and you want to make sure that you are and you want to make sure that you are separating it out from all the main

separating it out from all the main separating it out from all the main normal stuff that you're doing in in normal stuff that you're doing in in normal stuff that you're doing in in your life and your business. You don't your life and your business. You don't

your life and your business. You don't want to give it access to your email. I want to give it access to your email. I want to give it access to your email. I would highly recommend against that.

would highly recommend against that. would highly recommend against that. Okay. Um certain services you might need Okay. Um certain services you might need Okay. Um certain services you might need to log in with certain accounts. What I to log in with certain accounts. What I

to log in with certain accounts. What I do is I remote access in and I log in. do is I remote access in and I log in. do is I remote access in and I log in. You could also give access to the agent You could also give access to the agent You could also give access to the agent with tools like either Last Pass. You

with tools like either Last Pass. You with tools like either Last Pass. You could use LastPass or you could use could use LastPass or you could use could use LastPass or you could use something like um uh what's it called?

something like um uh what's it called? something like um uh what's it called? Uh is it bit bit defender? Uh is it bit bit defender?

Uh is it bit bit defender? No, it's not Bit Defender. There's No, it's not Bit Defender. There's No, it's not Bit Defender. There's there's something that that that my there's something that that that my there's something that that that my agents found that's also a really great

agents found that's also a really great agents found that's also a really great like password storage thing so that I like password storage thing so that I like password storage thing so that I could share different login or passwords could share different login or passwords

could share different login or passwords and accounts. The way that you want to and accounts. The way that you want to and accounts. The way that you want to think about open claw is that it is its think about open claw is that it is its think about open claw is that it is its own uh person or employee or thing that

own uh person or employee or thing that own uh person or employee or thing that can function on its own the same way can function on its own the same way can function on its own the same way that like a human employee would. If you that like a human employee would. If you

that like a human employee would. If you brought an employee on in your business, brought an employee on in your business, brought an employee on in your business, you would give them their own email you would give them their own email you would give them their own email account. you would securely share

account. you would securely share account. you would securely share passwords with them. And so that's how I passwords with them. And so that's how I passwords with them. And so that's how I think about it is it's the same kind of think about it is it's the same kind of

think about it is it's the same kind of thing with that. Now, here's the other thing with that. Now, here's the other thing with that. Now, here's the other thing that you want. You don't want your thing that you want. You don't want your thing that you want. You don't want your agent logging into like

[10:09]

agent logging into like agent logging into like sites that they can get prompt injected. sites that they can get prompt injected.

sites that they can get prompt injected. That's one of the issues. They could That's one of the issues. They could That's one of the issues. They could read things in in email. They could read read things in in email. They could read read things in in email. They could read stuff off of X. They could go to this

stuff off of X. They could go to this stuff off of X. They could go to this site called Moltbook, which is all these site called Moltbook, which is all these site called Moltbook, which is all these agents that are talking and they and it agents that are talking and they and it

agents that are talking and they and it could get prompt injected that way. Now, could get prompt injected that way. Now, could get prompt injected that way. Now, I'm not necessarily scared of that I'm not necessarily scared of that I'm not necessarily scared of that because I'm not

because I'm not because I'm not using cheap uh language models with my using cheap uh language models with my using cheap uh language models with my agent. I'm using Clawude Opus 4.6 using agent. I'm using Clawude Opus 4.6 using

agent. I'm using Clawude Opus 4.6 using a Claude Max account. So, if you set one a Claude Max account. So, if you set one a Claude Max account. So, if you set one of these up, you're going to need to of these up, you're going to need to of these up, you're going to need to have a Claude Max account of some kind

have a Claude Max account of some kind have a Claude Max account of some kind uh to do this. The the max plan on uh to do this. The the max plan on uh to do this. The the max plan on Claude starts at $100, but you'll hit Claude starts at $100, but you'll hit

Claude starts at $100, but you'll hit that pretty quickly using one of these that pretty quickly using one of these that pretty quickly using one of these agents. And so, yes, it might cost you agents. And so, yes, it might cost you agents. And so, yes, it might cost you $200 a month to be able to run a couple

$200 a month to be able to run a couple $200 a month to be able to run a couple of agents using a Claude Max account of agents using a Claude Max account of agents using a Claude Max account this way. Okay, this way. Okay,

this way. Okay, but what have I been able to do with but what have I been able to do with but what have I been able to do with this? Way more than I can with my this? Way more than I can with my this? Way more than I can with my virtual assistants. They can download

virtual assistants. They can download virtual assistants. They can download videos for me. They can upload them to videos for me. They can upload them to videos for me. They can upload them to different platforms. They can process different platforms. They can process

different platforms. They can process all my content to give me bulletoint all my content to give me bulletoint all my content to give me bulletoint lists and things like that. They can lists and things like that. They can lists and things like that. They can create software tools that I can use to

create software tools that I can use to create software tools that I can use to build my business and to help my build my business and to help my build my business and to help my clients. You know, one of the software clients. You know, one of the software

clients. You know, one of the software tools that we that we created was this tools that we that we created was this tools that we that we created was this uh uh peptides platform here for Sandy uh uh peptides platform here for Sandy uh uh peptides platform here for Sandy Kowski that we're that we're working on.

Kowski that we're that we're working on. Kowski that we're that we're working on. This is for members only, of course, This is for members only, of course, This is for members only, of course, right here as part of what she's doing.

right here as part of what she's doing. right here as part of what she's doing. But we were able to build a HIPPA But we were able to build a HIPPA But we were able to build a HIPPA compliant uh peptides platform. And so compliant uh peptides platform. And so

compliant uh peptides platform. And so this is amazing the ability that what this is amazing the ability that what this is amazing the ability that what we've been able to do with OpenClaw to we've been able to do with OpenClaw to we've been able to do with OpenClaw to be able to get this set up. Now, the way

be able to get this set up. Now, the way be able to get this set up. Now, the way that I use it is I just talk to it like that I use it is I just talk to it like that I use it is I just talk to it like a person and I get into a conversation a person and I get into a conversation

a person and I get into a conversation with my agent where I'm telling it what with my agent where I'm telling it what with my agent where I'm telling it what I want it to do, what I want it to I want it to do, what I want it to I want it to do, what I want it to accomplish. I have it going through and

accomplish. I have it going through and accomplish. I have it going through and it has a project management board. It it has a project management board. It it has a project management board. It has the ability to do project management has the ability to do project management

has the ability to do project management things. It has the ability to um tell me things. It has the ability to um tell me things. It has the ability to um tell me what projects each day. It says what what projects each day. It says what what projects each day. It says what it's working on. I have multiple agents

it's working on. I have multiple agents it's working on. I have multiple agents that are collaborating on different that are collaborating on different that are collaborating on different projects that are working together and projects that are working together and

[12:09]

projects that are working together and they're talking just like real humans. they're talking just like real humans. they're talking just like real humans. We have it set up inside of here where We have it set up inside of here where We have it set up inside of here where the agents can literally talk back and

the agents can literally talk back and the agents can literally talk back and forth and they can share different forth and they can share different forth and they can share different projects and different things that projects and different things that

projects and different things that they're working on and different ideas, they're working on and different ideas, they're working on and different ideas, different things and structure and different things and structure and different things and structure and different ways that they can help my

different ways that they can help my different ways that they can help my business. And I prompted them to do this business. And I prompted them to do this business. And I prompted them to do this every single day where they're able to every single day where they're able to

every single day where they're able to do this. They work on my Facebook ads. do this. They work on my Facebook ads. do this. They work on my Facebook ads. They I have a I have an agent that's a They I have a I have an agent that's a They I have a I have an agent that's a mental health agent is one that's really

mental health agent is one that's really mental health agent is one that's really helpful. Even I have one that helps me helpful. Even I have one that helps me helpful. Even I have one that helps me with stuff for client businesses. I have with stuff for client businesses. I have

with stuff for client businesses. I have one that helps me with all the tasks for one that helps me with all the tasks for one that helps me with all the tasks for my coaching program, one that comes with my coaching program, one that comes with my coaching program, one that comes with ideas for YouTube videos and things like

ideas for YouTube videos and things like ideas for YouTube videos and things like this. And so again, using these agents this. And so again, using these agents this. And so again, using these agents is incredibly powerful to set one up.

is incredibly powerful to set one up. is incredibly powerful to set one up. What you have to do is again, you want What you have to do is again, you want What you have to do is again, you want to have your machine that you're using to have your machine that you're using

to have your machine that you're using and you go over to openclaw.ai AI and and you go over to openclaw.ai AI and and you go over to openclaw.ai AI and quick start. If you're on a Mac OS, you quick start. If you're on a Mac OS, you quick start. If you're on a Mac OS, you can actually just download it right here

can actually just download it right here can actually just download it right here or you type this into the command line. or you type this into the command line.

or you type this into the command line. Now, you're going to have to use the Now, you're going to have to use the Now, you're going to have to use the command line. What is the command line?

command line. What is the command line? command line. What is the command line? It's like the old school DOSS terminal It's like the old school DOSS terminal It's like the old school DOSS terminal is what it is. And so, there is some is what it is. And so, there is some

is what it is. And so, there is some access and things like that that you're access and things like that that you're access and things like that that you're going to need to have and some technical going to need to have and some technical going to need to have and some technical skills that you're going to need to

skills that you're going to need to skills that you're going to need to have, but overall being able to use have, but overall being able to use have, but overall being able to use these tools is just incredible. And what these tools is just incredible. And what

these tools is just incredible. And what I've done is this. I've done is this. I've done is this. I've stopped having to learn how I've stopped having to learn how I've stopped having to learn how everything works. I just ask my agent to

everything works. I just ask my agent to everything works. I just ask my agent to go read the documentation and figure it go read the documentation and figure it go read the documentation and figure it out. I ask my agents to go figure out out. I ask my agents to go figure out

out. I ask my agents to go figure out how to do things. And then I help direct how to do things. And then I help direct how to do things. And then I help direct them and guide them and and and and keep them and guide them and and and and keep them and guide them and and and and keep them moving forward to help them build

them moving forward to help them build them moving forward to help them build stuff that they're wanting to build. I stuff that they're wanting to build. I stuff that they're wanting to build. I give them access to a GitHub account give them access to a GitHub account

give them access to a GitHub account that they can push things to for their that they can push things to for their that they can push things to for their own projects. They can't push my own own projects. They can't push my own own projects. They can't push my own projects, but they can do on their own

projects, but they can do on their own projects, but they can do on their own projects. They actually walk me through projects. They actually walk me through projects. They actually walk me through the process of setting up Slack. Okay, the process of setting up Slack. Okay,

the process of setting up Slack. Okay, where do I need to go to click on where do I need to go to click on where do I need to go to click on things? What? And then I tell them, can things? What? And then I tell them, can things? What? And then I tell them, can you go click on this yourself? Can you

you go click on this yourself? Can you you go click on this yourself? Can you go do this yourself? And it says, sure, go do this yourself? And it says, sure, go do this yourself? And it says, sure, I can. Now, some things like the I can. Now, some things like the

[14:11]

I can. Now, some things like the internet is not necessarily built, the internet is not necessarily built, the internet is not necessarily built, the internet has actually been built where internet has actually been built where internet has actually been built where it doesn't work best for agents like

it doesn't work best for agents like it doesn't work best for agents like this. And that's one of the things it this. And that's one of the things it this. And that's one of the things it still needs like a human to go in and still needs like a human to go in and

still needs like a human to go in and click certain things um on certain click certain things um on certain click certain things um on certain websites, but it can do most of the websites, but it can do most of the websites, but it can do most of the stuff that you want to do. And then

stuff that you want to do. And then stuff that you want to do. And then outside of that, um, it will say like outside of that, um, it will say like outside of that, um, it will say like I'll say, "Hey, can you open the window I'll say, "Hey, can you open the window

I'll say, "Hey, can you open the window up on my computer?" It'll open up a up on my computer?" It'll open up a up on my computer?" It'll open up a crown a Chrome browser automatically.

crown a Chrome browser automatically. crown a Chrome browser automatically. It'll go to the website and tell me, It'll go to the website and tell me, It'll go to the website and tell me, "Okay, click that button right there.

"Okay, click that button right there. "Okay, click that button right there. Type this in and then press run." It Type this in and then press run." It Type this in and then press run." It literally just did that for me this literally just did that for me this

literally just did that for me this morning because it was having trouble morning because it was having trouble morning because it was having trouble being able to do that on its own for being able to do that on its own for being able to do that on its own for whatever reason. Maybe the website was

whatever reason. Maybe the website was whatever reason. Maybe the website was blocking it. And so blocking it. And so blocking it. And so I'm able to then interface with it and I'm able to then interface with it and

I'm able to then interface with it and say, "Okay, I did this. I did that." and say, "Okay, I did this. I did that." and say, "Okay, I did this. I did that." and I'm able to kind of be a human in the I'm able to kind of be a human in the I'm able to kind of be a human in the loop that helps it do what it needs to

loop that helps it do what it needs to loop that helps it do what it needs to do to get stuff accomplished. It knows do to get stuff accomplished. It knows do to get stuff accomplished. It knows what my goals are. Has all of my what my goals are. Has all of my

what my goals are. Has all of my business content loaded into it. Has all business content loaded into it. Has all business content loaded into it. Has all the trainings that I've done. It has all the trainings that I've done. It has all the trainings that I've done. It has all the goals and resources and things that

the goals and resources and things that the goals and resources and things that I've created in my business to be able I've created in my business to be able I've created in my business to be able to create the kind of stuff that it to create the kind of stuff that it

to create the kind of stuff that it wants to that it wants to create. And wants to that it wants to create. And wants to that it wants to create. And it's not necessarily coming up with it's not necessarily coming up with it's not necessarily coming up with ideas and doing stuff autonomously on

ideas and doing stuff autonomously on ideas and doing stuff autonomously on its own. I'm directing everything. We its own. I'm directing everything. We its own. I'm directing everything. We created a project management system with created a project management system with

created a project management system with my agents where it manages projects. my agents where it manages projects. my agents where it manages projects. There's a number of different tools that There's a number of different tools that There's a number of different tools that it's actually created. I actually have a

it's actually created. I actually have a it's actually created. I actually have a list of them here on my uh MacBook Air. list of them here on my uh MacBook Air.

list of them here on my uh MacBook Air. I want to pull this up here just so you I want to pull this up here just so you I want to pull this up here just so you can kind of see it. What I did was I had can kind of see it. What I did was I had can kind of see it. What I did was I had it create this whole thing. It's called

it create this whole thing. It's called it create this whole thing. It's called CL Claude tools. And so like one of them CL Claude tools. And so like one of them CL Claude tools. And so like one of them is a uh a canban board where I can I can is a uh a canban board where I can I can

is a uh a canban board where I can I can log in and I can kind of see what this log in and I can kind of see what this log in and I can kind of see what this looks like.

looks like. looks like. Let me see Let me see Let me see here.

Okay, I created an account. Okay, I created an account. And so then what this gives me access to And so then what this gives me access to And so then what this gives me access to see is this is a project management see is this is a project management

see is this is a project management system board that my agents actually system board that my agents actually system board that my agents actually created that shows me what are they created that shows me what are they created that shows me what are they working on, who's taking over certain

working on, who's taking over certain working on, who's taking over certain projects, things like that. What's in projects, things like that. What's in projects, things like that. What's in the pipeline that we're working on, the pipeline that we're working on,

the pipeline that we're working on, different things that we've discussed to different things that we've discussed to different things that we've discussed to work on, different assignees, and all of work on, different assignees, and all of work on, different assignees, and all of this that are in here.

[16:17]

this that are in here. this that are in here. Um, what are some other tools that it's Um, what are some other tools that it's Um, what are some other tools that it's created for me? Uh, let's see. A daily created for me? Uh, let's see. A daily

created for me? Uh, let's see. A daily dashboard. I can see a daily dashboard dashboard. I can see a daily dashboard dashboard. I can see a daily dashboard for my business of all the different for my business of all the different for my business of all the different stuff that helps me in my business. I

stuff that helps me in my business. I stuff that helps me in my business. I can see a dashboard for one of my helper can see a dashboard for one of my helper can see a dashboard for one of my helper agents. I have this thing called agent agents. I have this thing called agent

agents. I have this thing called agent desk, transcript flow, script generator, desk, transcript flow, script generator, desk, transcript flow, script generator, content calendar generator, transcript content calendar generator, transcript content calendar generator, transcript flow. I have one that writes emails, uh,

flow. I have one that writes emails, uh, flow. I have one that writes emails, uh, one that does checkout sequences in my one that does checkout sequences in my one that does checkout sequences in my business. I have uh a version of chat business. I have uh a version of chat

business. I have uh a version of chat GPT that I created that has different AI GPT that I created that has different AI GPT that I created that has different AI agents in them. I have an advertisement agents in them. I have an advertisement agents in them. I have an advertisement generator bot where I can generate ads

generator bot where I can generate ads generator bot where I can generate ads and things like that for my business. and things like that for my business.

and things like that for my business. This one's actually really cool. We This one's actually really cool. We This one's actually really cool. We generated lots of different ads in one generated lots of different ads in one generated lots of different ads in one sequence for different different clients

sequence for different different clients sequence for different different clients and projects and stuff like that. and projects and stuff like that.

and projects and stuff like that. And so And so And so the possibilities are endless. These are the possibilities are endless. These are the possibilities are endless. These are all the different software tools that my

all the different software tools that my all the different software tools that my agents created right there. The agents created right there. The agents created right there. The possibilities are endless with this is possibilities are endless with this is

possibilities are endless with this is really with open claw and with these really with open claw and with these really with open claw and with these agents like this. It's like I was able agents like this. It's like I was able agents like this. It's like I was able to hire a not just a 14 person team but

to hire a not just a 14 person team but to hire a not just a 14 person team but a 50 person team, a 75 person team, a a 50 person team, a 75 person team, a a 50 person team, a 75 person team, a hundred, a thousand person team even hundred, a thousand person team even

hundred, a thousand person team even eventually each agent can spin out sub eventually each agent can spin out sub eventually each agent can spin out sub agents to do certain tasks. And because agents to do certain tasks. And because agents to do certain tasks. And because they have superhuman intelligence,

they have superhuman intelligence, they have superhuman intelligence, literally the level of intelligence is a literally the level of intelligence is a literally the level of intelligence is a PhD and higher level and it knows how to PhD and higher level and it knows how to

PhD and higher level and it knows how to do everything and it can research what do everything and it can research what do everything and it can research what it doesn't know. I've given my agents it doesn't know. I've given my agents it doesn't know. I've given my agents the ability they can go do deep research

the ability they can go do deep research the ability they can go do deep research across different platforms and bring all across different platforms and bring all across different platforms and bring all the answers back together to learn the answers back together to learn

the answers back together to learn things, to learn new skills. I created a things, to learn new skills. I created a things, to learn new skills. I created a mental health agent that actually learns mental health agent that actually learns mental health agent that actually learns as I talk with it about my uh my life

as I talk with it about my uh my life as I talk with it about my uh my life and my my beliefs and feelings and and and my my beliefs and feelings and and and my my beliefs and feelings and and helps me optimize myself to show up as a helps me optimize myself to show up as a

helps me optimize myself to show up as a more powerful version of myself overall. more powerful version of myself overall. more powerful version of myself overall. And that's exactly what it does. It And that's exactly what it does. It And that's exactly what it does. It helps me show up more confidently by

helps me show up more confidently by helps me show up more confidently by talking through what are my triggers and talking through what are my triggers and talking through what are my triggers and things like that. and it remembers things like that. and it remembers

[18:17]

things like that. and it remembers everything. So, these agents are everything. So, these agents are everything. So, these agents are lifechanging what they're able to do, lifechanging what they're able to do, lifechanging what they're able to do, what they're able to create, and you're

what they're able to create, and you're what they're able to create, and you're able to set it up right now. They they able to set it up right now. They they able to set it up right now. They they they've added in now new things like it they've added in now new things like it

they've added in now new things like it says OpenClaw partners with virus total says OpenClaw partners with virus total says OpenClaw partners with virus total to look at skill security to make sure to look at skill security to make sure to look at skill security to make sure that certain skills on the clawub

that certain skills on the clawub that certain skills on the clawub marketplace don't have viruses in them, marketplace don't have viruses in them, marketplace don't have viruses in them, which is amazing. So now we can trust which is amazing. So now we can trust

which is amazing. So now we can trust that going to Clawhub, which has that going to Clawhub, which has that going to Clawhub, which has different skills and things in it. You different skills and things in it. You different skills and things in it. You know, I've avoided a lot of the skills

know, I've avoided a lot of the skills know, I've avoided a lot of the skills that are on Clawhub just because they've that are on Clawhub just because they've that are on Clawhub just because they've been kind of dangerous, but now there's been kind of dangerous, but now there's

been kind of dangerous, but now there's all these different skills that they're all these different skills that they're all these different skills that they're they're verified as virus free. They they're verified as virus free. They they're verified as virus free. They don't have anything in them that's going

don't have anything in them that's going don't have anything in them that's going to necessarily hurt you or your or your to necessarily hurt you or your or your to necessarily hurt you or your or your agents. And this adds new skills now agents. And this adds new skills now

agents. And this adds new skills now into your agent that it can do thousands into your agent that it can do thousands into your agent that it can do thousands of different things for you and your of different things for you and your of different things for you and your business. Right now, it's a little bit

business. Right now, it's a little bit business. Right now, it's a little bit the wild west, all of this. And that's the wild west, all of this. And that's the wild west, all of this. And that's why like I'm I'm going over this. It's a why like I'm I'm going over this. It's a

why like I'm I'm going over this. It's a lot more disorganized than say we would lot more disorganized than say we would lot more disorganized than say we would like it. Again, some of the best agent like it. Again, some of the best agent like it. Again, some of the best agent tools that are out there right now that

tools that are out there right now that tools that are out there right now that are easy to use are easy to use are easy to use are the following.

Lovable.dev. You can build any website Lovable.dev. You can build any website that you want, any idea, even apps with that you want, any idea, even apps with that you want, any idea, even apps with lovable and it's built on Claude Opus lovable and it's built on Claude Opus

lovable and it's built on Claude Opus 4.6. Highly recommend this to anybody of 4.6. Highly recommend this to anybody of 4.6. Highly recommend this to anybody of any skill set. It works just like chat any skill set. It works just like chat any skill set. It works just like chat GPT. You tell it what you want to build

GPT. You tell it what you want to build GPT. You tell it what you want to build and in one prompt, even the free version and in one prompt, even the free version and in one prompt, even the free version can spin up really ridiculously high can spin up really ridiculously high

can spin up really ridiculously high quality versions of software and ideas quality versions of software and ideas quality versions of software and ideas that you might have. Another one is that you might have. Another one is that you might have. Another one is Manis.im.

Manis.im. Manis.im. Manis is an agent platform. It's owned Manis is an agent platform. It's owned Manis is an agent platform. It's owned by Meta. And what it's able to do is by Meta. And what it's able to do is

by Meta. And what it's able to do is it's able to literally go out there. The it's able to literally go out there. The it's able to literally go out there. The agents are able to go out there and just agents are able to go out there and just agents are able to go out there and just create all kinds of different things.

create all kinds of different things. create all kinds of different things. Look at this. They just added this Look at this. They just added this Look at this. They just added this persistent memory and computer to claim persistent memory and computer to claim

persistent memory and computer to claim your own agent. This is so cool. They your own agent. This is so cool. They your own agent. This is so cool. They added in their own version of OpenClaw added in their own version of OpenClaw added in their own version of OpenClaw into Manis. This is brand new. They just

[20:17]

into Manis. This is brand new. They just into Manis. This is brand new. They just added this. Oh, that's exciting. I'm added this. Oh, that's exciting. I'm added this. Oh, that's exciting. I'm going to have to play with this. So, if going to have to play with this. So, if

going to have to play with this. So, if you want to even get started with agents you want to even get started with agents you want to even get started with agents like this, they just added in this type like this, they just added in this type like this, they just added in this type of thing right here into Manis as well

of thing right here into Manis as well of thing right here into Manis as well to have persistent memory and and a to have persistent memory and and a to have persistent memory and and a computer that it can use to do different computer that it can use to do different

computer that it can use to do different stuff if you have a Manis account. I stuff if you have a Manis account. I stuff if you have a Manis account. I don't know what the cost is on it, but don't know what the cost is on it, but don't know what the cost is on it, but that's pretty cool. Uh, GenSpark AI.

that's pretty cool. Uh, GenSpark AI. that's pretty cool. Uh, GenSpark AI. This is another one, another agent This is another one, another agent This is another one, another agent platform right here to be able to create platform right here to be able to create

platform right here to be able to create and do all kinds of different agentic and do all kinds of different agentic and do all kinds of different agentic tasks. Claude uh has a platform called tasks. Claude uh has a platform called tasks. Claude uh has a platform called Co-work as part of their system. It it

Co-work as part of their system. It it Co-work as part of their system. It it also is a piece of software that can do also is a piece of software that can do also is a piece of software that can do a lot of stuff on your computer. It can a lot of stuff on your computer. It can

a lot of stuff on your computer. It can it can do different tasks for you on it can do different tasks for you on it can do different tasks for you on your computer. Not quite as good as your computer. Not quite as good as your computer. Not quite as good as OpenClaw, but it's amazing what it can

OpenClaw, but it's amazing what it can OpenClaw, but it's amazing what it can do. And so those are just some tools, do. And so those are just some tools, do. And so those are just some tools, Manis, Lovable, GenSpark, or Claude Manis, Lovable, GenSpark, or Claude

Manis, Lovable, GenSpark, or Claude Co-work that you could do to kind of Co-work that you could do to kind of Co-work that you could do to kind of play around with agents and agentic play around with agents and agentic play around with agents and agentic skills that can do stuff and things like

skills that can do stuff and things like skills that can do stuff and things like that. I think the manis uh agent that that. I think the manis uh agent that that. I think the manis uh agent that you can claim that has its own you can claim that has its own

you can claim that has its own persistent memory and computer basically persistent memory and computer basically persistent memory and computer basically they're probably open sourcing openclaw they're probably open sourcing openclaw they're probably open sourcing openclaw in some way to do this um is awesome. Um

in some way to do this um is awesome. Um in some way to do this um is awesome. Um but then getting your own open claw set but then getting your own open claw set but then getting your own open claw set up on its own separate computer or up on its own separate computer or

up on its own separate computer or virtual server or things like that. I virtual server or things like that. I virtual server or things like that. I I'm excited to be able to I want to set I'm excited to be able to I want to set I'm excited to be able to I want to set some of these up for some people again.

some of these up for some people again. some of these up for some people again. Um leave a leave a comment. Go just join Um leave a leave a comment. Go just join Um leave a leave a comment. Go just join the wait list. Go to the wait list. Go to

the wait list. Go to openclaw.jeremiahowski.com. join the wait list for this to work with join the wait list for this to work with me to have you set up your own agent and me to have you set up your own agent and me to have you set up your own agent and things like that and then we can get

things like that and then we can get things like that and then we can get going and help you get started on these going and help you get started on these going and help you get started on these different things like this. I'm excited different things like this. I'm excited

different things like this. I'm excited to show you how to do this, how this to show you how to do this, how this to show you how to do this, how this works, and get things launched for you.

works, and get things launched for you. works, and get things launched for you. I think it's going to be incredible. All I think it's going to be incredible. All I think it's going to be incredible. All right, we'll talk soon. Have a good one.
