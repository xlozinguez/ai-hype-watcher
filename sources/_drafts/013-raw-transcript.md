# Raw Transcript

0:00 Now, let's have a look at adding an image to this hero section. Please generate an image of a woman jogging next to the beach. The agent correctly identified that it's got access to our image generator skill. And if we have a look at it, we get this image with this little chatbot saying, "Hey, you got this. Keep going." And our displayer was replaced with an image generated by Claude Code. We can use skills to give our agents access to extra capabilities. Like you saw in the intro, we were able to get Claude code to generate images, which is something that Claude can't do natively. So, in this video, you'll learn everything you need to know to get started with using skills, from finding and installing skills to creating your very own skills. We'll also have a look at the differences between skills, MCP servers, and custom commands. And we'll also look at advanced topics like creating skills that rely on sensitive data like API keys.

0:55 So I think this infographic describes it best. We can use skills to teach claude code how to do something that it couldn't do natively. For example, generating images. Skills are basically markdown files with very precise instructions. And along with those instructions, we can also include any other resources. For example, if the agent needs to generate an image, the markdown file will contain precise instructions on how to use a Python script to generate those images. Or another example is the front-end design skill which provides a lot of context and resources for building high-quality UI designs. So we can use skills to specify very specific workflows and even provide domain knowledge.

1:47 So basically we can use skills to take the existing knowledge built into claude along with any tools that it already has access to to execute very specific workflows. Skills get confused with MCP servers all the time. But the real difference is that MCP servers simply provide new tools to the agent. So these tools could give the agent access to control a browser window or to access a database etc. And of course we can combine skills with tools to create very specialized workflows and custom commands are purely reusable prompts. Whereas skills is actually auto-activated by the agent based on the conversations context. If we ask the agent to generate an image, it will then see it's got access to the image generation skill, pull in that skills markdown file and then follow the instructions in that file to generate an image. Of course, for the MCP servers and any other tools, those will always be available in the agents context. So, yes, you could have a tool that can generate images as well, but keep in mind that tool along with all of its meta data will be preloaded into the agent's context and consume tokens, whether or not the agent needs the tool or not. That's why in some instances skills are preferred over MCP servers because skills actually take up very little context.

3:38 Building a fitness app landing page without skills - using only Claude's training data. Then using skills to greatly improve the design.

4:02 Installing skills using the plugin marketplace - the built-in plugins function within Claude code, Anthropic's official repository.

5:44 Installing skills from skills.sh - Vercel's open agent skills ecosystem. Find skills skill, skill creator skill, React best practices skill, front-end design skill, browser use skill.

8:37 Viewing installed skills and token usage - skills barely use any tokens, Claude only loads minimum context. Only when needed does it dive into skill folders.

9:46 Using the front-end design skill to fix UI - explicitly asking agent to use the skill, agent loads skill into memory at that point.

11:00 Browser use skill for verifying changes - agent goes through the page checking if everything is okay.

11:29 Adding AI image generation to Claude Code - giving it a skill to teach it how to generate images.

12:34 Creating skills with the skill creator skill - using Nano Banana Pro model from Google for image generation.

15:55 Handling API keys securely with env variables - don't hardcode keys in skills, use .env files excluded by git.

17:46 Testing the custom image generator skill - running the Python script to generate images.

19:01 Image optimization skill for web performance - resizing and converting to webp, reducing 631KB to 56KB.

20:40 Final result - placeholder replaced with AI-generated, optimized image. Skills give Claude Code capabilities it doesn't have natively.
