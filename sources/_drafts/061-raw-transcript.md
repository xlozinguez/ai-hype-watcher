[0:00]

My view on AI is that the future is My view on AI is that the future is massively overhyped, but the current massively overhyped, but the current massively overhyped, but the current capabilities of the models and what they capabilities of the models and what they

capabilities of the models and what they can do is largely underhyped. AI doesn't can do is largely underhyped. AI doesn't can do is largely underhyped. AI doesn't have to get better to be useful. You can have to get better to be useful. You can have to get better to be useful. You can do things like take a set of

do things like take a set of do things like take a set of construction drawings and extract every construction drawings and extract every construction drawings and extract every relevant material requirement to make relevant material requirement to make

relevant material requirement to make your procurement easier. You can your procurement easier. You can your procurement easier. You can cross-check your estimates and bid cross-check your estimates and bid cross-check your estimates and bid submissions against the project

submissions against the project submissions against the project requirements to look for errors and requirements to look for errors and requirements to look for errors and gaps. Or you can set up an analyzer gaps. Or you can set up an analyzer

gaps. Or you can set up an analyzer feature in your inbox to track and flag feature in your inbox to track and flag feature in your inbox to track and flag any important commercial correspondence any important commercial correspondence any important commercial correspondence that you might have missed. Maybe these

that you might have missed. Maybe these that you might have missed. Maybe these are useful applications for you or maybe are useful applications for you or maybe are useful applications for you or maybe they're not. But with a little bit of they're not. But with a little bit of

they're not. But with a little bit of creativity and effort, I am 100% sure creativity and effort, I am 100% sure creativity and effort, I am 100% sure that you can find useful applications that you can find useful applications that you can find useful applications for AI to your construction business.

for AI to your construction business. for AI to your construction business. Does that mean you should be using it to Does that mean you should be using it to Does that mean you should be using it to prepare estimates without checking or prepare estimates without checking or

prepare estimates without checking or rely on it to write an important email rely on it to write an important email rely on it to write an important email to your clients? Well, no. Of course to your clients? Well, no. Of course to your clients? Well, no. Of course not. It hallucinates. It misses context.

not. It hallucinates. It misses context. not. It hallucinates. It misses context. And it has some important limitations And it has some important limitations And it has some important limitations like being able to read and understand like being able to read and understand

like being able to read and understand construction drawings properly. We need construction drawings properly. We need construction drawings properly. We need to be strategic with how and when we to be strategic with how and when we to be strategic with how and when we apply it so we're playing to its

apply it so we're playing to its apply it so we're playing to its strengths and we're not falling into its strengths and we're not falling into its strengths and we're not falling into its weaknesses. So, my goal for the video is weaknesses. So, my goal for the video is

weaknesses. So, my goal for the video is simply to answer the question, how can simply to answer the question, how can simply to answer the question, how can you become an AI first construction you become an AI first construction you become an AI first construction company without focusing on these

company without focusing on these company without focusing on these overexaggerated future use cases and overexaggerated future use cases and overexaggerated future use cases and finding realistic, practical finding realistic, practical

finding realistic, practical applications that actually save you time applications that actually save you time applications that actually save you time and money? How can you make use of and money? How can you make use of and money? How can you make use of potentially the most transformative

potentially the most transformative potentially the most transformative technology since the internet? Now, technology since the internet? Now, technology since the internet? Now, maybe I overhype AI and I'll fall into maybe I overhype AI and I'll fall into

maybe I overhype AI and I'll fall into the trap, but you can make the judgment the trap, but you can make the judgment the trap, but you can make the judgment for yourself. This video is really just for yourself. This video is really just for yourself. This video is really just going to be all about giving you a

going to be all about giving you a going to be all about giving you a practical definition of what I mean by practical definition of what I mean by practical definition of what I mean by AI first and using an integrated AI first and using an integrated

AI first and using an integrated approach to adopting AI versus an ad hoc approach to adopting AI versus an ad hoc approach to adopting AI versus an ad hoc approach where it makes sense to apply approach where it makes sense to apply approach where it makes sense to apply AI and where it doesn't. Different ways

AI and where it doesn't. Different ways AI and where it doesn't. Different ways to use and apply AI that can be through to use and apply AI that can be through to use and apply AI that can be through chatbots, software or automations and chatbots, software or automations and

[2:04]

chatbots, software or automations and specific use cases and operational specific use cases and operational specific use cases and operational applications of AI. We'll look at applications of AI. We'll look at applications of AI. We'll look at everything from accounting to estimating

everything from accounting to estimating everything from accounting to estimating to project management and again where it to project management and again where it to project management and again where it actually makes sense to apply AI. And actually makes sense to apply AI. And

actually makes sense to apply AI. And then finally, I'll talk about the then finally, I'll talk about the then finally, I'll talk about the foundations or core principles like foundations or core principles like foundations or core principles like structured data and an understanding of

structured data and an understanding of structured data and an understanding of the fundamental project management the fundamental project management the fundamental project management processes that you need to actually make processes that you need to actually make

processes that you need to actually make AI useful. Okay. So, first I want to AI useful. Okay. So, first I want to AI useful. Okay. So, first I want to define AI first and I want to put the define AI first and I want to put the define AI first and I want to put the brakes on the hype train. AI is and

brakes on the hype train. AI is and brakes on the hype train. AI is and never will 10 times your business. It's never will 10 times your business. It's never will 10 times your business. It's not going to fix the inherent problems not going to fix the inherent problems

not going to fix the inherent problems in the construction industry like in the construction industry like in the construction industry like largely commoditized services and a race largely commoditized services and a race largely commoditized services and a race to the bottom market, brutal contracting

to the bottom market, brutal contracting to the bottom market, brutal contracting and cash flow positions. And it's not and cash flow positions. And it's not and cash flow positions. And it's not going to solve aggressive bad clients going to solve aggressive bad clients

going to solve aggressive bad clients and bad project managers and employees. and bad project managers and employees. and bad project managers and employees. The construction industry has real The construction industry has real The construction industry has real constraints to growth. and intelligence

constraints to growth. and intelligence constraints to growth. and intelligence was never actually the constraints to was never actually the constraints to was never actually the constraints to most construction companies to begin most construction companies to begin

most construction companies to begin with. So, it's not automatically going with. So, it's not automatically going with. So, it's not automatically going to be the solution. So, maybe it's not to be the solution. So, maybe it's not to be the solution. So, maybe it's not the core constraint, but intelligence

the core constraint, but intelligence the core constraint, but intelligence does constrain operational performance. does constrain operational performance.

does constrain operational performance. Think about this. If you had 100 or a Think about this. If you had 100 or a Think about this. If you had 100 or a thousand project managers that could thousand project managers that could thousand project managers that could work for you for little or no cost, you

work for you for little or no cost, you work for you for little or no cost, you would likely get better results on your would likely get better results on your would likely get better results on your projects. Now there's obviously a law of projects. Now there's obviously a law of

projects. Now there's obviously a law of diminishing returns and it's not as diminishing returns and it's not as diminishing returns and it's not as clearcut as if you had 100 or a thousand clearcut as if you had 100 or a thousand clearcut as if you had 100 or a thousand you get a thousand times results but you

you get a thousand times results but you you get a thousand times results but you would be able to perform core project would be able to perform core project would be able to perform core project management project controls accounting management project controls accounting

management project controls accounting all these functions much more better and all these functions much more better and all these functions much more better and effectively. It doesn't solve problems effectively. It doesn't solve problems effectively. It doesn't solve problems like running into unexpected ground

like running into unexpected ground like running into unexpected ground conditions or going for a project when conditions or going for a project when conditions or going for a project when you have a competitor who's you have a competitor who's

you have a competitor who's significantly under bidding. But significantly under bidding. But significantly under bidding. But projects run well versus projects run projects run well versus projects run projects run well versus projects run badly can have significantly different

badly can have significantly different badly can have significantly different financial outcomes. A bad estimate can financial outcomes. A bad estimate can financial outcomes. A bad estimate can bankrupt a construction business. A bankrupt a construction business. A

bankrupt a construction business. A missed claim will lead to lost revenue missed claim will lead to lost revenue missed claim will lead to lost revenue and incorrect material orders will delay and incorrect material orders will delay and incorrect material orders will delay projects and increase cost. Now, these

[4:06]

projects and increase cost. Now, these projects and increase cost. Now, these sorts of mistakes are not 100% sorts of mistakes are not 100% sorts of mistakes are not 100% preventable with AI. I'm not making the preventable with AI. I'm not making the

preventable with AI. I'm not making the promise that they are, but we can begin promise that they are, but we can begin promise that they are, but we can begin to build processes where we add more and to build processes where we add more and to build processes where we add more and more intelligence to them to reduce the

more intelligence to them to reduce the more intelligence to them to reduce the chances of things like this happening. chances of things like this happening.

chances of things like this happening. The way I see the role of AI and how to The way I see the role of AI and how to The way I see the role of AI and how to think about applying it within a think about applying it within a think about applying it within a construction business is what are the

construction business is what are the construction business is what are the important tasks you know you should be important tasks you know you should be important tasks you know you should be doing or would do if you had more doing or would do if you had more

doing or would do if you had more resources. For example, spending more resources. For example, spending more resources. For example, spending more time reviewing your estimates or time reviewing your estimates or time reviewing your estimates or reviewing your contracts before you sign

reviewing your contracts before you sign reviewing your contracts before you sign them or maintaining a detailed them or maintaining a detailed them or maintaining a detailed correspondence register with a client or correspondence register with a client or

correspondence register with a client or even stuff as simple as every time you even stuff as simple as every time you even stuff as simple as every time you have a meeting with a client or a key have a meeting with a client or a key have a meeting with a client or a key subcontractor you take meeting minutes

subcontractor you take meeting minutes subcontractor you take meeting minutes and note them down. So coming back to and note them down. So coming back to and note them down. So coming back to this definition of what I actually mean this definition of what I actually mean

this definition of what I actually mean by AI first. Well, I define it as by AI first. Well, I define it as by AI first. Well, I define it as applying intelligence to tasks where applying intelligence to tasks where applying intelligence to tasks where previously it wouldn't have been

previously it wouldn't have been previously it wouldn't have been economical to do so. If you're a economical to do so. If you're a economical to do so. If you're a construction business, a small construction business, a small

construction business, a small contractor, you probably can't allow for contractor, you probably can't allow for contractor, you probably can't allow for seven project managers and project seven project managers and project seven project managers and project engineers on a small project. Your

engineers on a small project. Your engineers on a small project. Your overheads would mean you never win the overheads would mean you never win the overheads would mean you never win the work. And if you do get the project, you work. And if you do get the project, you

work. And if you do get the project, you wouldn't have the budget for them. But wouldn't have the budget for them. But wouldn't have the budget for them. But using simple tools like AI where it's using simple tools like AI where it's using simple tools like AI where it's integrated into software or setting up

integrated into software or setting up integrated into software or setting up your own automations, you can begin to your own automations, you can begin to your own automations, you can begin to start to chip away at some of these start to chip away at some of these

start to chip away at some of these important tasks that historically important tasks that historically important tasks that historically wouldn't have been economical to do.

wouldn't have been economical to do. wouldn't have been economical to do. Really, I see the role of AI as not Really, I see the role of AI as not Really, I see the role of AI as not necessarily fundamentally reshaping the necessarily fundamentally reshaping the

necessarily fundamentally reshaping the entire way we manage a project, but just entire way we manage a project, but just entire way we manage a project, but just being able to do the fundamentals being able to do the fundamentals being able to do the fundamentals better. And to do this, I come to the ad

better. And to do this, I come to the ad better. And to do this, I come to the ad hoc verse the integrated approach. To hoc verse the integrated approach. To hoc verse the integrated approach. To reliably do this, we need to better reliably do this, we need to better

reliably do this, we need to better integrate AI into our processes, not integrate AI into our processes, not integrate AI into our processes, not just ad hoc and randomly use it.

just ad hoc and randomly use it. just ad hoc and randomly use it. Everyone uses Chat GVT to draft emails, Everyone uses Chat GVT to draft emails, Everyone uses Chat GVT to draft emails, ask questions. It's become a surrogate ask questions. It's become a surrogate

ask questions. It's become a surrogate Google search. This isn't an AI first or Google search. This isn't an AI first or Google search. This isn't an AI first or an integrated approach. This is just an integrated approach. This is just an integrated approach. This is just randomly ad hoc usage, which isn't bad,

randomly ad hoc usage, which isn't bad, randomly ad hoc usage, which isn't bad, but it's the same thing everybody's but it's the same thing everybody's but it's the same thing everybody's doing. So an integrated approach to doing. So an integrated approach to

doing. So an integrated approach to using AI would be having AI contract using AI would be having AI contract using AI would be having AI contract reviews integrated to your tendering reviews integrated to your tendering reviews integrated to your tendering process. So every contract before you

[6:13]

process. So every contract before you process. So every contract before you sign it, AI extracts key terms, compares sign it, AI extracts key terms, compares sign it, AI extracts key terms, compares them to your standard terms and them to your standard terms and

them to your standard terms and conditions, flags departures, and conditions, flags departures, and conditions, flags departures, and generates the first draft of your generates the first draft of your generates the first draft of your departure register and identifies any

departure register and identifies any departure register and identifies any key commercial risks you need to budget key commercial risks you need to budget key commercial risks you need to budget for in your estimate. The human then for in your estimate. The human then

for in your estimate. The human then reviews the output. And it's not an reviews the output. And it's not an reviews the output. And it's not an optional step. It's a fundamental part optional step. It's a fundamental part optional step. It's a fundamental part of your process. it's integrated into

of your process. it's integrated into of your process. it's integrated into the process. So to find use cases of the process. So to find use cases of the process. So to find use cases of where it makes sense to integrate AI where it makes sense to integrate AI

where it makes sense to integrate AI into a process, we need to understand into a process, we need to understand into a process, we need to understand what it's good at and what it's bad at.

what it's good at and what it's bad at. what it's good at and what it's bad at. So later on I'll talk about the specific So later on I'll talk about the specific So later on I'll talk about the specific tools and the specific domains where you tools and the specific domains where you

tools and the specific domains where you would apply it. But just generally AI is would apply it. But just generally AI is would apply it. But just generally AI is good at summarizing and distilling large good at summarizing and distilling large good at summarizing and distilling large documents, first drafts and generating

documents, first drafts and generating documents, first drafts and generating registers, checking and verifying registers, checking and verifying registers, checking and verifying outputs. For example, cross referencing outputs. For example, cross referencing

outputs. For example, cross referencing and checking your estimate against the and checking your estimate against the and checking your estimate against the bid requirements, pattern matching, so bid requirements, pattern matching, so bid requirements, pattern matching, so comparing contract terms, and processing

comparing contract terms, and processing comparing contract terms, and processing huge amount of volume without taking or huge amount of volume without taking or huge amount of volume without taking or costing a huge amount. Now, that's what costing a huge amount. Now, that's what

costing a huge amount. Now, that's what it's good at, but what about what it's it's good at, but what about what it's it's good at, but what about what it's bad at? Because understanding what it's bad at? Because understanding what it's bad at? Because understanding what it's bad at is essential to understanding

bad at is essential to understanding bad at is essential to understanding where it actually makes sense to apply. where it actually makes sense to apply.

where it actually makes sense to apply. So, AI is not good at specific judgment So, AI is not good at specific judgment So, AI is not good at specific judgment calls. So, things like, should we take calls. So, things like, should we take calls. So, things like, should we take this job? Should we not? In this

this job? Should we not? In this this job? Should we not? In this situation, would it make sense to accept situation, would it make sense to accept situation, would it make sense to accept liquidated damages or should we push liquidated damages or should we push

liquidated damages or should we push back on them entirely? Doesn't back on them entirely? Doesn't back on them entirely? Doesn't understand inherently business risk or understand inherently business risk or understand inherently business risk or the context behind it. The next

the context behind it. The next the context behind it. The next limitation of AI is actually getting it limitation of AI is actually getting it limitation of AI is actually getting it to stay current and up to date with your to stay current and up to date with your

to stay current and up to date with your information context. Obviously, AI can't information context. Obviously, AI can't information context. Obviously, AI can't go walk around the construction site. It go walk around the construction site. It go walk around the construction site. It can't call subcontractors and suppliers.

can't call subcontractors and suppliers. can't call subcontractors and suppliers. Can't go through your project documents Can't go through your project documents Can't go through your project documents or find some obscure file. It's or find some obscure file. It's

or find some obscure file. It's fundamentally got a knowledge cut off in fundamentally got a knowledge cut off in fundamentally got a knowledge cut off in the actual training model. But then the actual training model. But then the actual training model. But then also, unless you connect it to your

also, unless you connect it to your also, unless you connect it to your tools and your documents and your tools and your documents and your tools and your documents and your background information, there's always background information, there's always

background information, there's always limitations to what context it actually limitations to what context it actually limitations to what context it actually has, which is always going to limit its has, which is always going to limit its has, which is always going to limit its ability to do tasks. The next challenge

ability to do tasks. The next challenge ability to do tasks. The next challenge we all know about is that AI we all know about is that AI we all know about is that AI hallucinates. It can confidently make hallucinates. It can confidently make

hallucinates. It can confidently make stuff up. It can be fundamentally wrong stuff up. It can be fundamentally wrong stuff up. It can be fundamentally wrong about things in a way we don't about things in a way we don't about things in a way we don't understand or we would think is is

[8:17]

understand or we would think is is understand or we would think is is completely nonsensical, but it wouldn't completely nonsensical, but it wouldn't completely nonsensical, but it wouldn't necessarily always come up with AI. The necessarily always come up with AI. The

necessarily always come up with AI. The next one is tool access. So we can log next one is tool access. So we can log next one is tool access. So we can log into software, use it unless software is into software, use it unless software is into software, use it unless software is specifically designed with either API or

specifically designed with either API or specifically designed with either API or MCP access. So AI can natively integrate MCP access. So AI can natively integrate MCP access. So AI can natively integrate with it. A lot of the time it just can't with it. A lot of the time it just can't

with it. A lot of the time it just can't use the tools we needed to to do t. So use the tools we needed to to do t. So use the tools we needed to to do t. So for example, now you can integrate your for example, now you can integrate your for example, now you can integrate your Google drive with claude or chat GBT,

Google drive with claude or chat GBT, Google drive with claude or chat GBT, but specialist construction software but specialist construction software but specialist construction software like for example team binder and a like for example team binder and a

like for example team binder and a connects don't have these native AI connects don't have these native AI connects don't have these native AI integrations. So if you actually want integrations. So if you actually want integrations. So if you actually want them to do a useful task which involves

them to do a useful task which involves them to do a useful task which involves updating some sort of register in a updating some sort of register in a updating some sort of register in a software it fundamentally it's not software it fundamentally it's not

software it fundamentally it's not physically possible to do it yet. The physically possible to do it yet. The physically possible to do it yet. The next limitation to understand which is a next limitation to understand which is a next limitation to understand which is a bit more nuanced is visual reasoning. AI

bit more nuanced is visual reasoning. AI bit more nuanced is visual reasoning. AI can extract text very well but it can't can extract text very well but it can't can extract text very well but it can't necessarily process images and complex necessarily process images and complex

necessarily process images and complex construction drawings. So something we construction drawings. So something we construction drawings. So something we might actually think of as quite simple might actually think of as quite simple might actually think of as quite simple or intuitive like tracing a condute from

or intuitive like tracing a condute from or intuitive like tracing a condute from one drawing to another is almost one drawing to another is almost one drawing to another is almost impossible to get AI to do. And then you impossible to get AI to do. And then you

impossible to get AI to do. And then you also just have to be aware of the also just have to be aware of the also just have to be aware of the obvious task limitations. A lot of the obvious task limitations. A lot of the obvious task limitations. A lot of the time when we're doing construction work

time when we're doing construction work time when we're doing construction work or construction management work more or construction management work more or construction management work more specifically, a lot of it is like specifically, a lot of it is like

specifically, a lot of it is like calling people and getting information. calling people and getting information. calling people and getting information. AI can't do that. It's any time you're AI can't do that. It's any time you're AI can't do that. It's any time you're getting information from other people,

getting information from other people, getting information from other people, working with other people. It's like AI working with other people. It's like AI working with other people. It's like AI can't do it. So it's obviously so can't do it. So it's obviously so

can't do it. So it's obviously so limited by the fact that it's stuck in a limited by the fact that it's stuck in a limited by the fact that it's stuck in a computer can only do computer work which computer can only do computer work which computer can only do computer work which really is probably for project

really is probably for project really is probably for project engineering roles probably only 50% of engineering roles probably only 50% of engineering roles probably only 50% of the actual job. The final point I'll the actual job. The final point I'll

the actual job. The final point I'll make is the security and particularly make is the security and particularly make is the security and particularly data security limitations. This is both data security limitations. This is both data security limitations. This is both in terms of the actual security. For

in terms of the actual security. For in terms of the actual security. For example, if you give AI access to your example, if you give AI access to your example, if you give AI access to your emails, it could go and delete a whole emails, it could go and delete a whole

emails, it could go and delete a whole lot of things. It could send emails you lot of things. It could send emails you lot of things. It could send emails you don't want. So there's obviously the don't want. So there's obviously the don't want. So there's obviously the security and reliability, the actual

security and reliability, the actual security and reliability, the actual task it's doing and the risks associated task it's doing and the risks associated task it's doing and the risks associated with it doing the task badly. Then with it doing the task badly. Then

with it doing the task badly. Then there's also the data security. there's also the data security. there's also the data security. Sometimes you'll be working on projects Sometimes you'll be working on projects Sometimes you'll be working on projects and your clients will give you

and your clients will give you and your clients will give you confidential information in the contract confidential information in the contract confidential information in the contract you sign with them. There'll be specific you sign with them. There'll be specific

[10:18]

you sign with them. There'll be specific clauses in there about maintaining data clauses in there about maintaining data clauses in there about maintaining data security, not uploading it to the security, not uploading it to the security, not uploading it to the internet, these types of things. If

internet, these types of things. If internet, these types of things. If you're using AI, particularly if you're you're using AI, particularly if you're you're using AI, particularly if you're using the chat interfaces like chat and using the chat interfaces like chat and

using the chat interfaces like chat and claude, they actually train on your claude, they actually train on your claude, they actually train on your data. So you probably find you're data. So you probably find you're data. So you probably find you're violating your contracts by doing this.

violating your contracts by doing this. violating your contracts by doing this. You have to be a you just really have to You have to be a you just really have to You have to be a you just really have to be aware to data the data and security be aware to data the data and security

be aware to data the data and security concerns around using AI. Okay. So this concerns around using AI. Okay. So this concerns around using AI. Okay. So this leads us to the sweet spot of AI uses leads us to the sweet spot of AI uses leads us to the sweet spot of AI uses clear inputs and outputs definable rules

clear inputs and outputs definable rules clear inputs and outputs definable rules to follow human verifiable outputs and to follow human verifiable outputs and to follow human verifiable outputs and limited risk. A task should have a clear limited risk. A task should have a clear

limited risk. A task should have a clear trigger start point and end points when trigger start point and end points when trigger start point and end points when output it does. It should have rules or output it does. It should have rules or output it does. It should have rules or a system you get it to follow. You

a system you get it to follow. You a system you get it to follow. You should be able to verify the output and should be able to verify the output and should be able to verify the output and the limited risk. What I mean by this is the limited risk. What I mean by this is

the limited risk. What I mean by this is that if it hallucinates, if something that if it hallucinates, if something that if it hallucinates, if something goes wrong, it's not catastrophic. So, goes wrong, it's not catastrophic. So, goes wrong, it's not catastrophic. So, for example, AI preparing an estimate I

for example, AI preparing an estimate I for example, AI preparing an estimate I think is a bad use case of AI because think is a bad use case of AI because think is a bad use case of AI because there's just so much money on the line.

there's just so much money on the line. there's just so much money on the line. Even if there's a low probability that Even if there's a low probability that Even if there's a low probability that it hallucinates, hallucination would be it hallucinates, hallucination would be

it hallucinates, hallucination would be an absolute disaster in that situation. an absolute disaster in that situation. an absolute disaster in that situation. But using it to maybe prepare a budget But using it to maybe prepare a budget But using it to maybe prepare a budget estimate, which isn't a firm contractual

estimate, which isn't a firm contractual estimate, which isn't a firm contractual commitment, could be a good use case. Or commitment, could be a good use case. Or commitment, could be a good use case. Or using it to cross-check your estimate as using it to cross-check your estimate as

using it to cross-check your estimate as an additional layer of security, that is an additional layer of security, that is an additional layer of security, that is a good use case of AI. Okay, I want to a good use case of AI. Okay, I want to a good use case of AI. Okay, I want to stop the video here and bring up what I

stop the video here and bring up what I stop the video here and bring up what I think is an important point and think is an important point and think is an important point and something that is becoming increasingly something that is becoming increasingly

something that is becoming increasingly obvious to me over the past months where obvious to me over the past months where obvious to me over the past months where I've been working a lot with I've been working a lot with I've been working a lot with construction companies to implement AI.

construction companies to implement AI. construction companies to implement AI. Implementing AI is actually quite Implementing AI is actually quite Implementing AI is actually quite difficult. Sure. Sure. Using chatbt difficult. Sure. Sure. Using chatbt

difficult. Sure. Sure. Using chatbt claude, prompting it, all that stuff is claude, prompting it, all that stuff is claude, prompting it, all that stuff is relatively common sense, but actually relatively common sense, but actually relatively common sense, but actually building AI into a system like an

building AI into a system like an building AI into a system like an automation is something you should do. automation is something you should do.

automation is something you should do. It does make sense, but it takes a It does make sense, but it takes a It does make sense, but it takes a massive investment of time and massive investment of time and massive investment of time and resources. For example, recently I was

resources. For example, recently I was resources. For example, recently I was working with an electrical contractor to working with an electrical contractor to working with an electrical contractor to implement an AI document control system implement an AI document control system

implement an AI document control system that triggered automatically took that triggered automatically took that triggered automatically took information when the client sent it to information when the client sent it to information when the client sent it to him, stored it in the folders, and we're

him, stored it in the folders, and we're him, stored it in the folders, and we're just progressing down this path of just progressing down this path of just progressing down this path of system getting more and more system getting more and more

system getting more and more complicated. complicated. complicated. All these integrations into the All these integrations into the All these integrations into the automation getting increasingly complex.

automation getting increasingly complex. automation getting increasingly complex. And partway through I just came to the And partway through I just came to the And partway through I just came to the realization you're way better off just realization you're way better off just

realization you're way better off just getting someone on Upwork, hiring an getting someone on Upwork, hiring an getting someone on Upwork, hiring an engineer overseas if you're in the US or engineer overseas if you're in the US or engineer overseas if you're in the US or Australia at a fraction of the cost of

Australia at a fraction of the cost of Australia at a fraction of the cost of what you'd have to pay someone in what you'd have to pay someone in what you'd have to pay someone in Australia to do this for you. Pay them Australia to do this for you. Pay them

Australia to do this for you. Pay them to do it one day a week and you will get to do it one day a week and you will get to do it one day a week and you will get a result that is probably 10 to 100 a result that is probably 10 to 100 a result that is probably 10 to 100 times better than an AI system. Finding

times better than an AI system. Finding times better than an AI system. Finding good people on platforms like Upwork is, good people on platforms like Upwork is, good people on platforms like Upwork is, I would say, an unbelievably underrated I would say, an unbelievably underrated

I would say, an unbelievably underrated strategy. So yes, some situations it strategy. So yes, some situations it strategy. So yes, some situations it makes sense to apply AI. Other makes sense to apply AI. Other makes sense to apply AI. Other situations it would make sense just to

situations it would make sense just to situations it would make sense just to outsource the task to overseas and outsource the task to overseas and outsource the task to overseas and sometimes you'll find that the AI sometimes you'll find that the AI

sometimes you'll find that the AI equivalent of that task is more equivalent of that task is more equivalent of that task is more expensive, less reliable and less expensive, less reliable and less expensive, less reliable and less customizable. For example, I've been

customizable. For example, I've been customizable. For example, I've been looking into AI quantity takeoff tools looking into AI quantity takeoff tools looking into AI quantity takeoff tools and some of the pricing I've seen from and some of the pricing I've seen from

and some of the pricing I've seen from vendors is like 20 or 30 US per drawing vendors is like 20 or 30 US per drawing vendors is like 20 or 30 US per drawing and they don't even claim to be 100% and they don't even claim to be 100% and they don't even claim to be 100% accurate. Like you could probably get

accurate. Like you could probably get accurate. Like you could probably get somebody to do a takeoff on a drawing somebody to do a takeoff on a drawing somebody to do a takeoff on a drawing for a quarter of that cost and it would for a quarter of that cost and it would

for a quarter of that cost and it would be 100% accurate or as accurate as it be 100% accurate or as accurate as it be 100% accurate or as accurate as it could be. Okay, so how can you actually could be. Okay, so how can you actually could be. Okay, so how can you actually use AI? Well, there's really three

use AI? Well, there's really three use AI? Well, there's really three interfaces through which you can use AI. interfaces through which you can use AI.

interfaces through which you can use AI. Number one, the one we're used to would Number one, the one we're used to would Number one, the one we're used to would be a chat interface. This would be using be a chat interface. This would be using be a chat interface. This would be using something like Claude chat GBT or

something like Claude chat GBT or something like Claude chat GBT or Gemini. This is sort of good at ad hoc Gemini. This is sort of good at ad hoc Gemini. This is sort of good at ad hoc questions and queries. Document Q&amp;A questions and queries. Document Q&amp;A

questions and queries. Document Q&amp;A particularly if you actually you don't particularly if you actually you don't particularly if you actually you don't use Gemini use notebook LM and you can use Gemini use notebook LM and you can use Gemini use notebook LM and you can actually get AI to respond just on your

actually get AI to respond just on your actually get AI to respond just on your source documents. You can use it to source documents. You can use it to source documents. You can use it to prepare first drafts or for example here prepare first drafts or for example here

prepare first drafts or for example here I was using it to prepare I was using it I was using it to prepare I was using it I was using it to prepare I was using it to crosscheck an estimate I prepared and to crosscheck an estimate I prepared and to crosscheck an estimate I prepared and then based on that information I then

then based on that information I then then based on that information I then got it to create a schedule based on the got it to create a schedule based on the got it to create a schedule based on the data in the information. So there's lots data in the information. So there's lots

data in the information. So there's lots of different use cases here. The good of different use cases here. The good of different use cases here. The good thing about this, it's very easily thing about this, it's very easily thing about this, it's very easily customizable to exactly what you want it

customizable to exactly what you want it customizable to exactly what you want it to do. The other thing, it's good at to do. The other thing, it's good at to do. The other thing, it's good at when you connect it to a database. So, when you connect it to a database. So,

[14:20]

when you connect it to a database. So, when you actually connect it to sort of when you actually connect it to sort of when you actually connect it to sort of like a Google sheet where it's got your like a Google sheet where it's got your like a Google sheet where it's got your source information, it can pull and use

source information, it can pull and use source information, it can pull and use that. And it's good for brainstorming. that. And it's good for brainstorming.

that. And it's good for brainstorming. Now, where are these tools not good? Now, where are these tools not good? Now, where are these tools not good? Well, they're not good at consistent and Well, they're not good at consistent and Well, they're not good at consistent and repeatable tasks. Say you want it to

repeatable tasks. Say you want it to repeatable tasks. Say you want it to prepare a project management dashboard. prepare a project management dashboard.

prepare a project management dashboard. Claude, you can create quite nice user Claude, you can create quite nice user Claude, you can create quite nice user interfaces, but every time you get it to interfaces, but every time you get it to interfaces, but every time you get it to pull your data and create a dashboard,

pull your data and create a dashboard, pull your data and create a dashboard, the dashboard will be slightly the dashboard will be slightly the dashboard will be slightly different. Now, there are ways to different. Now, there are ways to

different. Now, there are ways to overcome this that I'll talk about, but overcome this that I'll talk about, but overcome this that I'll talk about, but it's not good at consistent repeatable it's not good at consistent repeatable it's not good at consistent repeatable tasks. They're not particularly good at

tasks. They're not particularly good at tasks. They're not particularly good at integrating into tools, although they integrating into tools, although they integrating into tools, although they are getting much better now. You can are getting much better now. You can

are getting much better now. You can quite easily connect things like notion quite easily connect things like notion quite easily connect things like notion drive or air table or the big apps allow drive or air table or the big apps allow drive or air table or the big apps allow you to connect them directly to Claude

you to connect them directly to Claude you to connect them directly to Claude and chat. They also don't allow you to and chat. They also don't allow you to and chat. They also don't allow you to automatically perform task prompt in automatically perform task prompt in

automatically perform task prompt in text or document out can't automatically text or document out can't automatically text or document out can't automatically trigger them to run well chatbt you can trigger them to run well chatbt you can trigger them to run well chatbt you can but the way it works I don't find that

but the way it works I don't find that but the way it works I don't find that useful other way you can actually use AI useful other way you can actually use AI useful other way you can actually use AI is to integrate it into an automation so is to integrate it into an automation so

is to integrate it into an automation so automation software if you're not automation software if you're not automation software if you're not familiar with them the things like nadn familiar with them the things like nadn familiar with them the things like nadn make.com or zapia and that's basically

make.com or zapia and that's basically make.com or zapia and that's basically where you can connect AI into a system where you can connect AI into a system where you can connect AI into a system this is good for repetitive workflows this is good for repetitive workflows

this is good for repetitive workflows data movement or triggered actions all data movement or triggered actions all data movement or triggered actions all right so if I show you a little example right so if I show you a little example right so if I show you a little example of what I'm talking about is this is an

of what I'm talking about is this is an of what I'm talking about is this is an automation to generate a progress report automation to generate a progress report automation to generate a progress report every week that just summarizes where every week that just summarizes where

every week that just summarizes where we're up to what percent different tasks we're up to what percent different tasks we're up to what percent different tasks are complete. It runs weekly so it's are complete. It runs weekly so it's are complete. It runs weekly so it's triggered by a schedule. It finds the

triggered by a schedule. It finds the triggered by a schedule. It finds the relevant data in air table. So it gets relevant data in air table. So it gets relevant data in air table. So it gets all your progress reports and all your progress reports and

all your progress reports and information. It structures that into a information. It structures that into a information. It structures that into a progress report using AI. So this is progress report using AI. So this is progress report using AI. So this is where AI is integrated into the

where AI is integrated into the where AI is integrated into the workflow. Then it sends an outbound workflow. Then it sends an outbound workflow. Then it sends an outbound email to the client. So it says, "This email to the client. So it says, "This

email to the client. So it says, "This week we did 500 meters of trenching. week we did 500 meters of trenching. week we did 500 meters of trenching. We're 30% complete. We laid x meters of We're 30% complete. We laid x meters of We're 30% complete. We laid x meters of condo blah blah blah." So it's just

condo blah blah blah." So it's just condo blah blah blah." So it's just basically every week running an basically every week running an basically every week running an automated progress report to keep our automated progress report to keep our

automated progress report to keep our client informed. So where do automations client informed. So where do automations client informed. So where do automations fall over? Well, any sort of complex fall over? Well, any sort of complex fall over? Well, any sort of complex decision making stuff. Obviously

decision making stuff. Obviously decision making stuff. Obviously automation is just a set series of automation is just a set series of automation is just a set series of steps. Any complexity or nuance to this, steps. Any complexity or nuance to this,

[16:23]

steps. Any complexity or nuance to this, it's not going to work. They often have it's not going to work. They often have it's not going to work. They often have more of an initial setup complexity.

more of an initial setup complexity. more of an initial setup complexity. Although Zapia is unbelievably easy to Although Zapia is unbelievably easy to Although Zapia is unbelievably easy to use, they do have some initial setup use, they do have some initial setup

use, they do have some initial setup complexity and again it's just complexity and again it's just complexity and again it's just constrained to the workflow. If you want constrained to the workflow. If you want constrained to the workflow. If you want to do something that falls outside of

to do something that falls outside of to do something that falls outside of the workflow, you either have to adjust the workflow, you either have to adjust the workflow, you either have to adjust the workflow or it's not going to be the workflow or it's not going to be

the workflow or it's not going to be possible. The next way to use AI is to possible. The next way to use AI is to possible. The next way to use AI is to use pre-built integrations other people use pre-built integrations other people use pre-built integrations other people have done in software packages we use.

have done in software packages we use. have done in software packages we use. So Procore has AI integrations. All the So Procore has AI integrations. All the So Procore has AI integrations. All the big construction management softwares big construction management softwares

big construction management softwares are rolling out AI integrations. This is are rolling out AI integrations. This is are rolling out AI integrations. This is an example of where I've used the AI in an example of where I've used the AI in an example of where I've used the AI in my estimating and contract management

my estimating and contract management my estimating and contract management software. Basically, what it does is you software. Basically, what it does is you software. Basically, what it does is you upload the scope of works and the upload the scope of works and the

upload the scope of works and the drawings. It analyzes that, extracts all drawings. It analyzes that, extracts all drawings. It analyzes that, extracts all the key quantities, does a summary of the key quantities, does a summary of the key quantities, does a summary of all the drawings, extracting all the

all the drawings, extracting all the all the drawings, extracting all the relevant pricing information, turns that relevant pricing information, turns that relevant pricing information, turns that into a list of requirements. So, every into a list of requirements. So, every

into a list of requirements. So, every pricing requirement that you need to pricing requirement that you need to pricing requirement that you need to capture in your price is structured and capture in your price is structured and capture in your price is structured and put in a list. Gives you any

put in a list. Gives you any put in a list. Gives you any discrepancies between the drawings and discrepancies between the drawings and discrepancies between the drawings and the scope of works. any RFIs or the scope of works. any RFIs or

the scope of works. any RFIs or clarifications you should ask and it clarifications you should ask and it clarifications you should ask and it does a simple risk and opportunity does a simple risk and opportunity does a simple risk and opportunity analysis. So, this is an example of

analysis. So, this is an example of analysis. So, this is an example of taking a set of bid documents, turning taking a set of bid documents, turning taking a set of bid documents, turning it into a report, telling you what's it into a report, telling you what's

it into a report, telling you what's missing, what you should clarify, what missing, what you should clarify, what missing, what you should clarify, what the risks are, extracting the key the risks are, extracting the key the risks are, extracting the key quantities from the drawings to make the

quantities from the drawings to make the quantities from the drawings to make the estimating process easier. So, that is estimating process easier. So, that is estimating process easier. So, that is done using AI, but you don't have to do done using AI, but you don't have to do

done using AI, but you don't have to do any setup. It's purpose-built any setup. It's purpose-built any setup. It's purpose-built functionality. Someone else has already functionality. Someone else has already functionality. Someone else has already set it up, tested it, made sure it

set it up, tested it, made sure it set it up, tested it, made sure it works. It's much easier to scale and works. It's much easier to scale and works. It's much easier to scale and generally the security and data generally the security and data

generally the security and data requirements are much better and I mean requirements are much better and I mean requirements are much better and I mean every one of these companies has every one of these companies has every one of these companies has security and data policies that you can

security and data policies that you can security and data policies that you can easily check out and read but the data easily check out and read but the data easily check out and read but the data in software tools generally depending on in software tools generally depending on

in software tools generally depending on what the specific vendor says they won't what the specific vendor says they won't what the specific vendor says they won't be using they will protect your data be using they will protect your data be using they will protect your data they're not using your data to train

they're not using your data to train they're not using your data to train future AR models which things like future AR models which things like future AR models which things like catchb and claw do now the negative to catchb and claw do now the negative to

catchb and claw do now the negative to this is this won't reflect your unique this is this won't reflect your unique this is this won't reflect your unique workflow this is just a standard way of workflow this is just a standard way of workflow this is just a standard way of doing it that is captured in the

[18:24]

doing it that is captured in the doing it that is captured in the software. You might have a different way software. You might have a different way software. You might have a different way you want to do it. You obviously have to you want to do it. You obviously have to

you want to do it. You obviously have to pay for the software. It's probably pay for the software. It's probably pay for the software. It's probably going to be more expensive than just going to be more expensive than just going to be more expensive than just using chat or claude directly. You have

using chat or claude directly. You have using chat or claude directly. You have some sort of you potentially have vendor some sort of you potentially have vendor some sort of you potentially have vendor lock in depending on what sort of data lock in depending on what sort of data

lock in depending on what sort of data you're inputting and how much complexity you're inputting and how much complexity you're inputting and how much complexity there is in setup. For example, once you there is in setup. For example, once you there is in setup. For example, once you start using an accounting software,

start using an accounting software, start using an accounting software, you're not going to change midway you're not going to change midway you're not going to change midway through the financial year. software through the financial year. software

through the financial year. software obviously has some sort of limited obviously has some sort of limited obviously has some sort of limited flexibility and then there's always the flexibility and then there's always the flexibility and then there's always the learning curve like you have to learn

learning curve like you have to learn learning curve like you have to learn how to use a new software. Okay, next up how to use a new software. Okay, next up how to use a new software. Okay, next up I'm going to fly through and talk about I'm going to fly through and talk about

I'm going to fly through and talk about some AI use cases under different some AI use cases under different some AI use cases under different domains like accounting, estimating, domains like accounting, estimating, domains like accounting, estimating, design management, projects management,

design management, projects management, design management, projects management, so on and so forth. I'm going to list so on and so forth. I'm going to list so on and so forth. I'm going to list out software applications that have done out software applications that have done

out software applications that have done this but obviously you can actually go this but obviously you can actually go this but obviously you can actually go and get these software or you can use and get these software or you can use and get these software or you can use them as inspiration for something you

them as inspiration for something you them as inspiration for something you want to do. Now again the specific your want to do. Now again the specific your want to do. Now again the specific your use case for your business might be use case for your business might be

use case for your business might be different. My rule I I think it's good different. My rule I I think it's good different. My rule I I think it's good to look at what other software vendors to look at what other software vendors to look at what other software vendors are doing because it gives you

are doing because it gives you are doing because it gives you inspiration for what you could do inspiration for what you could do inspiration for what you could do yourself and it shows you what is yourself and it shows you what is

yourself and it shows you what is actually technically possible. But actually technically possible. But actually technically possible. But really for you to identify use cases you really for you to identify use cases you really for you to identify use cases you just have to get good at identifying

just have to get good at identifying just have to get good at identifying problems having some understanding of AI problems having some understanding of AI problems having some understanding of AI and understanding how the technology and understanding how the technology

and understanding how the technology works and where it actually makes sense works and where it actually makes sense works and where it actually makes sense to apply. All right. So, accounting to apply. All right. So, accounting to apply. All right. So, accounting applications in construction I see sort

applications in construction I see sort applications in construction I see sort of fit into two buckets. You've got your of fit into two buckets. You've got your of fit into two buckets. You've got your making what you already do now easier.

making what you already do now easier. making what you already do now easier. For example, you could get a big For example, you could get a big For example, you could get a big confusing invoice from a supplier. An AI confusing invoice from a supplier. An AI

confusing invoice from a supplier. An AI invoice processor can extract the invoice processor can extract the invoice processor can extract the relevant pricing information from it relevant pricing information from it relevant pricing information from it rather than you having to manually go

rather than you having to manually go rather than you having to manually go through the invoice. You can do this through the invoice. You can do this through the invoice. You can do this with like Gemini or Claude or I use with like Gemini or Claude or I use

with like Gemini or Claude or I use Llama Pass a lot which is a specialist Llama Pass a lot which is a specialist Llama Pass a lot which is a specialist AI passer. The other category of AI passer. The other category of AI passer. The other category of applications in accounting are things

applications in accounting are things applications in accounting are things like predictive cash flow forecasting like predictive cash flow forecasting like predictive cash flow forecasting where you take as input the budget the where you take as input the budget the

where you take as input the budget the schedule payment terms and it uses to schedule payment terms and it uses to schedule payment terms and it uses to generate a cash flow forecast. So I generate a cash flow forecast. So I generate a cash flow forecast. So I think that's a good application of AI.

think that's a good application of AI. think that's a good application of AI. Pretty sure this software does it Pretty sure this software does it Pretty sure this software does it although I haven't actually played with although I haven't actually played with

although I haven't actually played with it but it just helps you to get better it but it just helps you to get better it but it just helps you to get better hold on your cash position. Then you've hold on your cash position. Then you've hold on your cash position. Then you've got estimating and quantity takeoffs.

[20:30]

got estimating and quantity takeoffs. got estimating and quantity takeoffs. Obviously this is the area I'm super Obviously this is the area I'm super Obviously this is the area I'm super interested in and what I've spent a lot interested in and what I've spent a lot

interested in and what I've spent a lot of time on. You can get automated of time on. You can get automated of time on. You can get automated quantity takeoffs. Again, the software quantity takeoffs. Again, the software quantity takeoffs. Again, the software that I've seen claims to be specialists

that I've seen claims to be specialists that I've seen claims to be specialists at this are insanely expensive, more at this are insanely expensive, more at this are insanely expensive, more expensive than getting an outsourcer to expensive than getting an outsourcer to

expensive than getting an outsourcer to do it and they don't claim to be 100% do it and they don't claim to be 100% do it and they don't claim to be 100% reliable. The way I focused on this use reliable. The way I focused on this use reliable. The way I focused on this use case is I use AI to extract an

case is I use AI to extract an case is I use AI to extract an indicative bill of quantities and indicative bill of quantities and indicative bill of quantities and doesn't claim to be correct. So, I doesn't claim to be correct. So, I

doesn't claim to be correct. So, I qualify that it's an indicative bill of qualify that it's an indicative bill of qualify that it's an indicative bill of quantities only, which I think is good quantities only, which I think is good quantities only, which I think is good for this use case of generating first

for this use case of generating first for this use case of generating first pass estimates and budget pricing. Would pass estimates and budget pricing. Would pass estimates and budget pricing. Would I get AI to actually prepare an estimate I get AI to actually prepare an estimate

I get AI to actually prepare an estimate for a lump sum $2 million contract? No, for a lump sum $2 million contract? No, for a lump sum $2 million contract? No, because there's way too much on the because there's way too much on the because there's way too much on the line. It's not a good use of AI. But I

line. It's not a good use of AI. But I line. It's not a good use of AI. But I think the other use case I really think the other use case I really think the other use case I really focused on building into my software was focused on building into my software was

focused on building into my software was using AI to crosscheck your estimates using AI to crosscheck your estimates using AI to crosscheck your estimates for errors and gaps. Then again, you've for errors and gaps. Then again, you've for errors and gaps. Then again, you've got tenders and contract management.

got tenders and contract management. got tenders and contract management. I've done a more detailed analysis of I've done a more detailed analysis of I've done a more detailed analysis of this on exactly how to review a contract this on exactly how to review a contract

this on exactly how to review a contract with AI. Again, if you just upload a with AI. Again, if you just upload a with AI. Again, if you just upload a contract in into AI and get it to do a contract in into AI and get it to do a contract in into AI and get it to do a summary of the key terms and conditions,

summary of the key terms and conditions, summary of the key terms and conditions, they actually just do a very good job. they actually just do a very good job.

they actually just do a very good job. You probably don't even need specialist You probably don't even need specialist You probably don't even need specialist software for this, but I have a specific software for this, but I have a specific software for this, but I have a specific process I like to go through to review

process I like to go through to review process I like to go through to review contracts with AI. But contract reviews contracts with AI. But contract reviews contracts with AI. But contract reviews is a very good use case because they're is a very good use case because they're

is a very good use case because they're just a big pattern matching exercise. just a big pattern matching exercise. just a big pattern matching exercise. But you can also get them to analyze But you can also get them to analyze But you can also get them to analyze your tender documents like the example I

your tender documents like the example I your tender documents like the example I showed you before where you're looking showed you before where you're looking showed you before where you're looking at getting extracting all the pricing at getting extracting all the pricing

at getting extracting all the pricing requirements to compare them to your requirements to compare them to your requirements to compare them to your estimate helping you to identify risks estimate helping you to identify risks estimate helping you to identify risks and opportunities. So I find the

and opportunities. So I find the and opportunities. So I find the artifact feature in Claude very very artifact feature in Claude very very artifact feature in Claude very very useful for this type of thing. But you useful for this type of thing. But you

useful for this type of thing. But you can take your project documents and you can take your project documents and you can take your project documents and you can get Claude to generate a GAN chart can get Claude to generate a GAN chart can get Claude to generate a GAN chart in the specific UI of a GAN chart. So no

in the specific UI of a GAN chart. So no in the specific UI of a GAN chart. So no more manually highlighting bars in Excel more manually highlighting bars in Excel more manually highlighting bars in Excel getting it to make trying to make some getting it to make trying to make some

getting it to make trying to make some pretty gant chart and every time you pretty gant chart and every time you pretty gant chart and every time you adjust something you adjust it. Claude adjust something you adjust it. Claude adjust something you adjust it. Claude can now very reliably just build Gant

can now very reliably just build Gant can now very reliably just build Gant charts and then you can just type and charts and then you can just type and charts and then you can just type and text to adjust them. So when that's run, text to adjust them. So when that's run,

text to adjust them. So when that's run, I'll actually show you what it looks I'll actually show you what it looks I'll actually show you what it looks like. But some other use cases for like. But some other use cases for like. But some other use cases for scheduling and is obviously creating

[22:34]

scheduling and is obviously creating scheduling and is obviously creating schedules with AI, optimizing schedules, schedules with AI, optimizing schedules, schedules with AI, optimizing schedules, risk forecasting, risk leveling, risk forecasting, risk leveling,

risk forecasting, risk leveling, schedule recovery plan. I saw this schedule recovery plan. I saw this schedule recovery plan. I saw this company called N Plan. Um they have company called N Plan. Um they have company called N Plan. Um they have basically trained their own AI on over

basically trained their own AI on over basically trained their own AI on over 750,000 projects. So obviously Chat GBD, 750,000 projects. So obviously Chat GBD, 750,000 projects. So obviously Chat GBD, Claude, things like that. They are Claude, things like that. They are

Claude, things like that. They are trained on all the data on the internet. trained on all the data on the internet. trained on all the data on the internet. But endplan interestingly enough is But endplan interestingly enough is But endplan interestingly enough is trained on 7 I don't know how they got

trained on 7 I don't know how they got trained on 7 I don't know how they got 750,000 projects but they are trained on 750,000 projects but they are trained on 750,000 projects but they are trained on basically a whole custom data set and basically a whole custom data set and

basically a whole custom data set and they will pick up specific things where they will pick up specific things where they will pick up specific things where they know adds risk to projects. For they know adds risk to projects. For they know adds risk to projects. For example, I spoke to someone from endplan

example, I spoke to someone from endplan example, I spoke to someone from endplan the other day and they were telling me the other day and they were telling me the other day and they were telling me they have found this really interesting they have found this really interesting

they have found this really interesting link between I can't remember exactly link between I can't remember exactly link between I can't remember exactly what it was. It was something like the what it was. It was something like the what it was. It was something like the duration of the piling program and the

duration of the piling program and the duration of the piling program and the early works excavation before it were early works excavation before it were early works excavation before it were linked. There was just these really linked. There was just these really

linked. There was just these really interesting insights that Bay had picked interesting insights that Bay had picked interesting insights that Bay had picked up again because they have a proprietary up again because they have a proprietary up again because they have a proprietary data set. They trained it on specialist

data set. They trained it on specialist data set. They trained it on specialist scheduling. They trained you on a lot of scheduling. They trained you on a lot of scheduling. They trained you on a lot of different schedules. So they can give different schedules. So they can give

different schedules. So they can give you much more accurate predictions and you much more accurate predictions and you much more accurate predictions and insights about risk. The next category insights about risk. The next category insights about risk. The next category of tools I've been saying come to safety

of tools I've been saying come to safety of tools I've been saying come to safety and compliance. They claim to do things and compliance. They claim to do things and compliance. They claim to do things like real-time hazard detection. And like real-time hazard detection. And

like real-time hazard detection. And basically the general way they seem to basically the general way they seem to basically the general way they seem to work when I was looking at um this one work when I was looking at um this one work when I was looking at um this one is they set up cameras around the site

is they set up cameras around the site is they set up cameras around the site and they use computer vision to monitor and they use computer vision to monitor and they use computer vision to monitor things like people wearing PPE. Now what things like people wearing PPE. Now what

things like people wearing PPE. Now what I've seen in my experience is if you set I've seen in my experience is if you set I've seen in my experience is if you set a up a whole lot of cameras around a a up a whole lot of cameras around a a up a whole lot of cameras around a construction site and start monitoring

construction site and start monitoring construction site and start monitoring what everyone would do, you might solve what everyone would do, you might solve what everyone would do, you might solve safety issues but you will create safety issues but you will create

safety issues but you will create industrial relations issues. So look, industrial relations issues. So look, industrial relations issues. So look, maybe some of these are good for big maybe some of these are good for big maybe some of these are good for big companies that have huge budgets.

companies that have huge budgets. companies that have huge budgets. I couldn't necessarily see the use cases I couldn't necessarily see the use cases I couldn't necessarily see the use cases of some of these software for smaller of some of these software for smaller

of some of these software for smaller contractors. I would say I actually contractors. I would say I actually contractors. I would say I actually spoke to someone the other day and they spoke to someone the other day and they spoke to someone the other day and they had a very interesting use case of AI

had a very interesting use case of AI had a very interesting use case of AI and safety where they basically done and safety where they basically done and safety where they basically done 2,000 toolbox talks. So, not toolbox 2,000 toolbox talks. So, not toolbox

[24:38]

2,000 toolbox talks. So, not toolbox talks. had done 2,000 job risk talks. had done 2,000 job risk talks. had done 2,000 job risk assessments and they basically used all assessments and they basically used all assessments and they basically used all these toolbox talks and created a

these toolbox talks and created a these toolbox talks and created a massive database of all the risks they massive database of all the risks they massive database of all the risks they were exposed to, the most common risks were exposed to, the most common risks

were exposed to, the most common risks they were exposed to, and then use that they were exposed to, and then use that they were exposed to, and then use that to plan their toolbox talks, which I to plan their toolbox talks, which I to plan their toolbox talks, which I thought was a very interesting insight

thought was a very interesting insight thought was a very interesting insight because basically, again, it's probably because basically, again, it's probably because basically, again, it's probably not going to change your construction not going to change your construction

not going to change your construction business dramatically, but it's just an business dramatically, but it's just an business dramatically, but it's just an example of one of those little 1% gains example of one of those little 1% gains example of one of those little 1% gains where they made the toolbox talks more

where they made the toolbox talks more where they made the toolbox talks more tailored to their work, and that was a tailored to their work, and that was a tailored to their work, and that was a data driven insight. Again, to get data driven insight. Again, to get

data driven insight. Again, to get someone to manually go through all those someone to manually go through all those someone to manually go through all those handwritten notes would have taken a handwritten notes would have taken a handwritten notes would have taken a lifetime. That is a very good use of AI.

lifetime. That is a very good use of AI. lifetime. That is a very good use of AI. Now, quality in completions. Again, the Now, quality in completions. Again, the Now, quality in completions. Again, the principle was very similar to what I saw principle was very similar to what I saw

principle was very similar to what I saw with the safety compliance where it with the safety compliance where it with the safety compliance where it relied on computer vision and monitoring relied on computer vision and monitoring relied on computer vision and monitoring construction sites. I mean, again, I

construction sites. I mean, again, I construction sites. I mean, again, I don't think that's the best use case. I don't think that's the best use case. I don't think that's the best use case. I think setting up cameras and watching think setting up cameras and watching

think setting up cameras and watching people work is something that will people work is something that will people work is something that will fundamentally cause industrial relations fundamentally cause industrial relations fundamentally cause industrial relations issues because workers won't be happy

issues because workers won't be happy issues because workers won't be happy with being watched whenever they're with being watched whenever they're with being watched whenever they're working. But I can see the benefits with working. But I can see the benefits with

working. But I can see the benefits with things like quantity verification. things like quantity verification. things like quantity verification. You could potentially get installation You could potentially get installation You could potentially get installation accuracy. I think where you do get

accuracy. I think where you do get accuracy. I think where you do get benefits with quality and completions is benefits with quality and completions is benefits with quality and completions is you can do things like document you can do things like document

you can do things like document verification. So comparing how drawings verification. So comparing how drawings verification. So comparing how drawings change from one revision to another, change from one revision to another, change from one revision to another, making sure that downstream documents

making sure that downstream documents making sure that downstream documents aren't impacted. For example, if you get aren't impacted. For example, if you get aren't impacted. For example, if you get an RFI, does it impact an ITP? Those are an RFI, does it impact an ITP? Those are

an RFI, does it impact an ITP? Those are checks you should be doing but probably checks you should be doing but probably checks you should be doing but probably don't do. The other use good case would don't do. The other use good case would don't do. The other use good case would be similar to the example of the toolbox

be similar to the example of the toolbox be similar to the example of the toolbox talks is you could look at all your talks is you could look at all your talks is you could look at all your historical defects and then you could historical defects and then you could

historical defects and then you could actually identify ways to improve the actually identify ways to improve the actually identify ways to improve the performance of the works going forward performance of the works going forward performance of the works going forward by identifying what are the key quality

by identifying what are the key quality by identifying what are the key quality and defect issues you run into. Again, and defect issues you run into. Again, and defect issues you run into. Again, the reason this hasn't been possible in the reason this hasn't been possible in

the reason this hasn't been possible in the past is if you think about a civil the past is if you think about a civil the past is if you think about a civil construction project and you have construction project and you have construction project and you have defects with a structure on 10 jobs,

defects with a structure on 10 jobs, defects with a structure on 10 jobs, they might use 10 different words to they might use 10 different words to they might use 10 different words to describe that same defect or 10 describe that same defect or 10

describe that same defect or 10 different sentences. In the past, it was different sentences. In the past, it was different sentences. In the past, it was impossible for you would have had to pay impossible for you would have had to pay impossible for you would have had to pay someone to manually go through every

[26:40]

someone to manually go through every someone to manually go through every single defect and categorize them. single defect and categorize them.

single defect and categorize them. They'd have to come up with reasonable They'd have to come up with reasonable They'd have to come up with reasonable buckets and then you probably lose some buckets and then you probably lose some buckets and then you probably lose some sort of detail when you're going through

sort of detail when you're going through sort of detail when you're going through this process. But you can use AI to do this process. But you can use AI to do this process. But you can use AI to do that. Now that that sort of large data that. Now that that sort of large data

that. Now that that sort of large data set analysis is a very good use case. set analysis is a very good use case. set analysis is a very good use case. Then we've got project management Then we've got project management Then we've got project management coordination. So things like document

coordination. So things like document coordination. So things like document search and retrieval, generating RFIs, search and retrieval, generating RFIs, search and retrieval, generating RFIs, tracking change orders, progress tracking change orders, progress

tracking change orders, progress reporting. This is an AI construction reporting. This is an AI construction reporting. This is an AI construction management platform called Mast that management platform called Mast that management platform called Mast that creates you can create project

creates you can create project creates you can create project dashboards. So you can type with text. dashboards. So you can type with text.

dashboards. So you can type with text. You can upload your project documents You can upload your project documents You can upload your project documents and then it will actually create a and then it will actually create a and then it will actually create a dashboard for tracking performance based

dashboard for tracking performance based dashboard for tracking performance based on the schedule, the budget, these sorts on the schedule, the budget, these sorts on the schedule, the budget, these sorts of things. So it's again it's just of things. So it's again it's just

of things. So it's again it's just making your job of creating dashboards making your job of creating dashboards making your job of creating dashboards something that you probably know you something that you probably know you something that you probably know you should do but aren't doing easier. Okay,

should do but aren't doing easier. Okay, should do but aren't doing easier. Okay, so those were example applications so those were example applications so those were example applications across each of the core domains. Some of across each of the core domains. Some of

across each of the core domains. Some of them maybe they're useful for you, some them maybe they're useful for you, some them maybe they're useful for you, some of them maybe you're not. The next part of them maybe you're not. The next part of them maybe you're not. The next part we need to talk about is how do you

we need to talk about is how do you we need to talk about is how do you actually get the most out of AI? So the actually get the most out of AI? So the actually get the most out of AI? So the number one most important thing you can number one most important thing you can

number one most important thing you can have to get more out of AI is data. What have to get more out of AI is data. What have to get more out of AI is data. What do I mean by data? It's using your do I mean by data? It's using your do I mean by data? It's using your information, your historic estimates,

information, your historic estimates, information, your historic estimates, your historic production rates, your your historic production rates, your your historic production rates, your specific project information as context specific project information as context

specific project information as context when you're getting AI to perform tasks. when you're getting AI to perform tasks. when you're getting AI to perform tasks. AI is simply trained on all the data AI is simply trained on all the data AI is simply trained on all the data they scraped from the internet. If you

they scraped from the internet. If you they scraped from the internet. If you want AI to produce an estimate for your want AI to produce an estimate for your want AI to produce an estimate for your project and you give it no additional project and you give it no additional

project and you give it no additional information, it will give you a terrible information, it will give you a terrible information, it will give you a terrible generic answer. But if you wanted to generic answer. But if you wanted to generic answer. But if you wanted to actually produce an estimate the right

actually produce an estimate the right actually produce an estimate the right way, you'd need to give it the drawings, way, you'd need to give it the drawings, way, you'd need to give it the drawings, the build quantities, the the build quantities, the

the build quantities, the specifications, your cost library, your specifications, your cost library, your specifications, your cost library, your historical production rates, all the historical production rates, all the historical production rates, all the different costs you incur for different

different costs you incur for different different costs you incur for different labor plan materials, subcontractor labor plan materials, subcontractor labor plan materials, subcontractor quotes, and any constructibility quotes, and any constructibility

quotes, and any constructibility constraints. If you give it all that constraints. If you give it all that constraints. If you give it all that information, all that data, you'll get a information, all that data, you'll get a information, all that data, you'll get a better outcome out of it simply because

better outcome out of it simply because better outcome out of it simply because you've given it more context. So, you've given it more context. So, you've given it more context. So, foundation number one is going to be foundation number one is going to be

foundation number one is going to be structured and easily accessible data. structured and easily accessible data. structured and easily accessible data. Now, I've sort of already covered this Now, I've sort of already covered this Now, I've sort of already covered this point to death, but foundation number

[28:44]

point to death, but foundation number point to death, but foundation number two is good use cases. Not everything two is good use cases. Not everything two is good use cases. Not everything benefits from AI. You shouldn't be benefits from AI. You shouldn't be

benefits from AI. You shouldn't be looking to apply AI to your business. looking to apply AI to your business. looking to apply AI to your business. You should be looking to solve problems.

You should be looking to solve problems. You should be looking to solve problems. Sometimes AI makes sense to solve those Sometimes AI makes sense to solve those Sometimes AI makes sense to solve those problems. Sometimes it doesn't. AI is problems. Sometimes it doesn't. AI is

problems. Sometimes it doesn't. AI is good with tasks where intelligence is good with tasks where intelligence is good with tasks where intelligence is the bottleneck. Things that you've done the bottleneck. Things that you've done the bottleneck. Things that you've done poorly because you couldn't justify the

poorly because you couldn't justify the poorly because you couldn't justify the time. Things not done at all because time. Things not done at all because time. Things not done at all because they're too timeconuming and you don't they're too timeconuming and you don't

they're too timeconuming and you don't have the budget for your overheads to have the budget for your overheads to have the budget for your overheads to manage them. High volume repetitive manage them. High volume repetitive manage them. High volume repetitive tasks and pattern matching against known

tasks and pattern matching against known tasks and pattern matching against known standards. This is a bad use case of AI. standards. This is a bad use case of AI.

standards. This is a bad use case of AI. There's a lot of money on the line when There's a lot of money on the line when There's a lot of money on the line when you prepare an estimate. It's hard to you prepare an estimate. It's hard to you prepare an estimate. It's hard to give it all the context. it's it's not

give it all the context. it's it's not give it all the context. it's it's not going to end well for you if that's how going to end well for you if that's how going to end well for you if that's how you're using AI. Now, foundation number you're using AI. Now, foundation number

you're using AI. Now, foundation number three is good guardrails. AI can make three is good guardrails. AI can make three is good guardrails. AI can make confident mistakes. We know it can confident mistakes. We know it can confident mistakes. We know it can hallucinate. It won't necessarily flag

hallucinate. It won't necessarily flag hallucinate. It won't necessarily flag you if it's missing context. So, every you if it's missing context. So, every you if it's missing context. So, every AI workflow should have human AI workflow should have human

AI workflow should have human verification. verification. verification. That's maybe not always going to be as That's maybe not always going to be as That's maybe not always going to be as simple as going through the entire work

simple as going through the entire work simple as going through the entire work the AI done because that would just be the AI done because that would just be the AI done because that would just be double doing. Having ways to check the double doing. Having ways to check the

double doing. Having ways to check the output, being able to make sure it made output, being able to make sure it made output, being able to make sure it made sense. For example, again, you get AI to sense. For example, again, you get AI to sense. For example, again, you get AI to prepare a budget estimate. You should

prepare a budget estimate. You should prepare a budget estimate. You should have another quick parallel way to do have another quick parallel way to do have another quick parallel way to do budget pricing to understand whether the budget pricing to understand whether the

budget pricing to understand whether the answer makes sense or not. Some error answer makes sense or not. Some error answer makes sense or not. Some error checking mechanism or validation against checking mechanism or validation against checking mechanism or validation against known data. So, some examples of where a

known data. So, some examples of where a known data. So, some examples of where a human would be able to catch error is if human would be able to catch error is if human would be able to catch error is if you get AI to extract the contract you get AI to extract the contract

you get AI to extract the contract terms, a human reviews them before terms, a human reviews them before terms, a human reviews them before signing and submitting. AI generates an signing and submitting. AI generates an signing and submitting. AI generates an estimate. A human does a sanity check of

estimate. A human does a sanity check of estimate. A human does a sanity check of the cost. AI flags correspondence risk. the cost. AI flags correspondence risk.

the cost. AI flags correspondence risk. The human decides whether to take action The human decides whether to take action The human decides whether to take action on them. Foundation number four is on them. Foundation number four is on them. Foundation number four is automation. So having an understanding

automation. So having an understanding automation. So having an understanding of how to automate different tasks and of how to automate different tasks and of how to automate different tasks and where it makes sense to apply where it makes sense to apply

where it makes sense to apply intelligence to it. So this is basically intelligence to it. So this is basically intelligence to it. So this is basically say you want to build an invoice say you want to build an invoice say you want to build an invoice processing system. How does it start?

[30:45]

processing system. How does it start? processing system. How does it start? What's the trigger for it? Is it an What's the trigger for it? Is it an What's the trigger for it? Is it an email being received? Is it uploading a email being received? Is it uploading a

email being received? Is it uploading a file to Google Drive? What is the data file to Google Drive? What is the data file to Google Drive? What is the data processing? How do you want to extract processing? How do you want to extract processing? How do you want to extract it? What is the output format you want

it? What is the output format you want it? What is the output format you want the data in? And what is the output the data in? And what is the output the data in? And what is the output action for the task? Having an action for the task? Having an

action for the task? Having an understanding of how to automate a task, understanding of how to automate a task, understanding of how to automate a task, not necessarily with AI, but just a good not necessarily with AI, but just a good not necessarily with AI, but just a good understanding of automation in general

understanding of automation in general understanding of automation in general and how automation tools work will give and how automation tools work will give and how automation tools work will give you much better applications. The last you much better applications. The last

you much better applications. The last two foundations is understanding two foundations is understanding two foundations is understanding limitations. understanding where it's limitations. understanding where it's limitations. understanding where it's more difficult to give the AI enough

more difficult to give the AI enough more difficult to give the AI enough context than it is to do the work context than it is to do the work context than it is to do the work yourself. Understanding what tools it's yourself. Understanding what tools it's

yourself. Understanding what tools it's possible to give it access to, what possible to give it access to, what possible to give it access to, what tools you can't. Understanding the tools you can't. Understanding the tools you can't. Understanding the hallucination risks and what actually

hallucination risks and what actually hallucination risks and what actually underlies and drives them. Understanding underlies and drives them. Understanding underlies and drives them. Understanding how and when it can process visual how and when it can process visual

how and when it can process visual information. So for example, I know AI information. So for example, I know AI information. So for example, I know AI can do good quantity takeoffs if it is can do good quantity takeoffs if it is can do good quantity takeoffs if it is counting something like a light fitting

counting something like a light fitting counting something like a light fitting using the text tag, but I know it will using the text tag, but I know it will using the text tag, but I know it will do a terrible job at measuring a conduit do a terrible job at measuring a conduit

do a terrible job at measuring a conduit that goes through a wall where there's that goes through a wall where there's that goes through a wall where there's not explicit measurements on the not explicit measurements on the not explicit measurements on the drawing. So building an understanding of

drawing. So building an understanding of drawing. So building an understanding of the limitations and working around those the limitations and working around those the limitations and working around those limitations. Now the final one is limitations. Now the final one is

limitations. Now the final one is understanding privacy and security rules understanding privacy and security rules understanding privacy and security rules and regulations about how to use it. If and regulations about how to use it. If and regulations about how to use it. If you sign a contract, it likely has in

you sign a contract, it likely has in you sign a contract, it likely has in there IP or data security information or there IP or data security information or there IP or data security information or potentially even a non-disclosure potentially even a non-disclosure

potentially even a non-disclosure agreement. That means you wouldn't be agreement. That means you wouldn't be agreement. That means you wouldn't be allowed to upload the data to unsecure allowed to upload the data to unsecure allowed to upload the data to unsecure servers or to things like chatbt where

servers or to things like chatbt where servers or to things like chatbt where they're training on your data. So, you they're training on your data. So, you they're training on your data. So, you just have to pay attention to the tools just have to pay attention to the tools

just have to pay attention to the tools you're working and understand the you're working and understand the you're working and understand the privacy and security implications of privacy and security implications of privacy and security implications of what you're doing. Okay, I want to wrap

what you're doing. Okay, I want to wrap what you're doing. Okay, I want to wrap up with three simple rules about how to up with three simple rules about how to up with three simple rules about how to actually go out and start doing stuff actually go out and start doing stuff

actually go out and start doing stuff with AI. Number one, start small. Pick a with AI. Number one, start small. Pick a with AI. Number one, start small. Pick a very niche problem that you can quickly very niche problem that you can quickly very niche problem that you can quickly solve in the simplest way possible.

solve in the simplest way possible. solve in the simplest way possible. Don't try to do the most complicated Don't try to do the most complicated Don't try to do the most complicated system ever. Start very small, very system ever. Start very small, very

system ever. Start very small, very simply and solve the problem. Basically, simply and solve the problem. Basically, simply and solve the problem. Basically, if you start where there's pain or time if you start where there's pain or time if you start where there's pain or time consuming or waste that is a good place

[32:46]

consuming or waste that is a good place consuming or waste that is a good place to start. Pick one problem, pick a small to start. Pick one problem, pick a small to start. Pick one problem, pick a small solvable problem. Then choose the right solvable problem. Then choose the right

solvable problem. Then choose the right tool for the software. Sorry, choose the tool for the software. Sorry, choose the tool for the software. Sorry, choose the right tool for the problem. Maybe right tool for the problem. Maybe right tool for the problem. Maybe software makes sense, maybe a chat

software makes sense, maybe a chat software makes sense, maybe a chat interface makes sense, maybe an interface makes sense, maybe an interface makes sense, maybe an automation makes sense, but I would say automation makes sense, but I would say

automation makes sense, but I would say automation would probably be more automation would probably be more automation would probably be more complicated. So, you'd want to start complicated. So, you'd want to start complicated. So, you'd want to start with either a chatbot or a pre-built

with either a chatbot or a pre-built with either a chatbot or a pre-built software. Then do a pilot project, software. Then do a pilot project, software. Then do a pilot project, measure the ROI, see if it's actually measure the ROI, see if it's actually

measure the ROI, see if it's actually saving people time, reducing errors, saving people time, reducing errors, saving people time, reducing errors, whether there's cost benefits, and then whether there's cost benefits, and then whether there's cost benefits, and then refine and scale it. So, start small and

refine and scale it. So, start small and refine and scale it. So, start small and then scaling. Now, we know to do this then scaling. Now, we know to do this then scaling. Now, we know to do this effectively, you're going to need some effectively, you're going to need some

effectively, you're going to need some sort of structured data in context that sort of structured data in context that sort of structured data in context that you can easily give to the AI, a clear you can easily give to the AI, a clear you can easily give to the AI, a clear use case where intelligence is the

use case where intelligence is the use case where intelligence is the bottleneck, guard rails in place, so bottleneck, guard rails in place, so bottleneck, guard rails in place, so some human verification process, some some human verification process, some

some human verification process, some automation capability if you're doing an automation capability if you're doing an automation capability if you're doing an automation and to know the boundaries of automation and to know the boundaries of automation and to know the boundaries of it. And then again, just measure

it. And then again, just measure it. And then again, just measure success. It should result in time-saving success. It should result in time-saving success. It should result in time-saving error reduction, safety improvements, or error reduction, safety improvements, or

error reduction, safety improvements, or quality gains, or a happier
