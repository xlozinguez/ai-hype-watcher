Welcome to Griffinomics. Welcome to Griffinomics. &gt;&gt; It is good to be back. And uh I think &gt;&gt; It is good to be back. And uh I think &gt;&gt; It is good to be back. And uh I think today we're tackling a subject that's today we're tackling a subject that's

today we're tackling a subject that's keeping a lot of people up at night. keeping a lot of people up at night. keeping a lot of people up at night. &gt;&gt; I think that's an understatement.

&gt;&gt; I think that's an understatement. &gt;&gt; I think that's an understatement. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Whether you're managing a you know &gt;&gt; Yeah. Whether you're managing a you know &gt;&gt; Yeah. Whether you're managing a you know a billion dollar portfolio or just a billion dollar portfolio or just

a billion dollar portfolio or just looking at your own 401k and wondering looking at your own 401k and wondering looking at your own 401k and wondering what on earth is going on.

what on earth is going on. what on earth is going on. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We are staring at what might be &gt;&gt; Yeah. We are staring at what might be &gt;&gt; Yeah. We are staring at what might be the most confusing market signal in I the most confusing market signal in I

the most confusing market signal in I don't know 20 years. It has to be don't know 20 years. It has to be don't know 20 years. It has to be &gt;&gt; because if you just look at the &gt;&gt; because if you just look at the &gt;&gt; because if you just look at the headlines or even just check your

headlines or even just check your headlines or even just check your portfolio app, it feels like we're portfolio app, it feels like we're portfolio app, it feels like we're living in two completely different living in two completely different

living in two completely different realities at the same time. realities at the same time. realities at the same time. &gt;&gt; That's the perfect way to put it. A tale &gt;&gt; That's the perfect way to put it. A tale &gt;&gt; That's the perfect way to put it. A tale of two markets.

of two markets. of two markets. &gt;&gt; It's a real white knuckle moment for &gt;&gt; It's a real white knuckle moment for &gt;&gt; It's a real white knuckle moment for anyone paying attention.

anyone paying attention. anyone paying attention. &gt;&gt; It is it's a moment of um extreme &gt;&gt; It is it's a moment of um extreme &gt;&gt; It is it's a moment of um extreme bifurcation. We haven't seen a split bifurcation. We haven't seen a split

bifurcation. We haven't seen a split this violent in a very very long time. this violent in a very very long time. this violent in a very very long time. &gt;&gt; Okay, so let's set the scene here. On &gt;&gt; Okay, so let's set the scene here. On &gt;&gt; Okay, so let's set the scene here. On one side, you have this this absolute

one side, you have this this absolute one side, you have this this absolute explosion in infrastructure. explosion in infrastructure.

explosion in infrastructure. &gt;&gt; The buildout. &gt;&gt; The buildout. &gt;&gt; The buildout. &gt;&gt; The buildout. You've got Nvidia, you've &gt;&gt; The buildout. You've got Nvidia, you've &gt;&gt; The buildout. You've got Nvidia, you've got the hyperscalers, Amazon, Microsoft,

got the hyperscalers, Amazon, Microsoft, got the hyperscalers, Amazon, Microsoft, Google Google Google &gt;&gt; spending money like it's going out of &gt;&gt; spending money like it's going out of

&gt;&gt; spending money like it's going out of style. style. style. &gt;&gt; I mean, it's a boom, a gold rush. It &gt;&gt; I mean, it's a boom, a gold rush. It &gt;&gt; I mean, it's a boom, a gold rush. It feels like the entire world is being

feels like the entire world is being feels like the entire world is being rebuilt from the ground up, rebuilt from the ground up, rebuilt from the ground up, &gt;&gt; right? The picks and shovels trade is uh &gt;&gt; right? The picks and shovels trade is uh

&gt;&gt; right? The picks and shovels trade is uh very much alive and well. The builders very much alive and well. The builders very much alive and well. The builders are having a party.

are having a party. are having a party. &gt;&gt; But then you look at the other side of &gt;&gt; But then you look at the other side of &gt;&gt; But then you look at the other side of the tech sector. You look at software.

the tech sector. You look at software. the tech sector. You look at software. You look at the traditional SAW You look at the traditional SAW You look at the traditional SAW company's software as a service and it company's software as a service and it

company's software as a service and it looks like a crime scene. looks like a crime scene. looks like a crime scene. &gt;&gt; It really does. It's a violent rotation.

&gt;&gt; It really does. It's a violent rotation. &gt;&gt; It really does. It's a violent rotation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A blood bath for some of these names. &gt;&gt; A blood bath for some of these names. &gt;&gt; A blood bath for some of these names. &gt;&gt; Stocks that were darlings just 2, three &gt;&gt; Stocks that were darlings just 2, three &gt;&gt; Stocks that were darlings just 2, three years ago, the set it and forget it

years ago, the set it and forget it years ago, the set it and forget it compounders, they are getting absolutely compounders, they are getting absolutely compounders, they are getting absolutely hammered, hammered,

hammered, &gt;&gt; just destroyed. &gt;&gt; just destroyed. &gt;&gt; just destroyed. &gt;&gt; So, the core tension we need to figure &gt;&gt; So, the core tension we need to figure &gt;&gt; So, the core tension we need to figure out today is why

out today is why out today is why why are software stocks crashing while why are software stocks crashing while why are software stocks crashing while the very hardware that powers them is the very hardware that powers them is

the very hardware that powers them is hitting all-time highs? hitting all-time highs? hitting all-time highs? &gt;&gt; That is the multi-t trillion dollar &gt;&gt; That is the multi-t trillion dollar &gt;&gt; That is the multi-t trillion dollar question, isn't it? Yeah.

question, isn't it? Yeah. question, isn't it? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And to answer it, you have to look &gt;&gt; And to answer it, you have to look &gt;&gt; And to answer it, you have to look beyond just the stock prices.

beyond just the stock prices. beyond just the stock prices. &gt;&gt; You have to go deeper. You have to look &gt;&gt; You have to go deeper. You have to look &gt;&gt; You have to go deeper. You have to look at the structural pivot that's happening at the structural pivot that's happening

at the structural pivot that's happening right underneath the surface. We are I right underneath the surface. We are I right underneath the surface. We are I think very clearly moving from what we think very clearly moving from what we think very clearly moving from what we can call the tool era of software

[2:01]

can call the tool era of software can call the tool era of software &gt;&gt; to the agentic era. &gt;&gt; to the agentic era.

&gt;&gt; to the agentic era. &gt;&gt; The agentic era. I love that term but it &gt;&gt; The agentic era. I love that term but it &gt;&gt; The agentic era. I love that term but it also sounds a little ominous.

also sounds a little ominous. also sounds a little ominous. &gt;&gt; It implies agency. It implies action. It &gt;&gt; It implies agency. It implies action. It &gt;&gt; It implies agency. It implies action. It implies autonomy.

implies autonomy. implies autonomy. &gt;&gt; It implies replacement. And that is &gt;&gt; It implies replacement. And that is &gt;&gt; It implies replacement. And that is disruptive. That's the polite word for disruptive. That's the polite word for

disruptive. That's the polite word for it. it. it. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, our mission for this deep dive &gt;&gt; Okay. So, our mission for this deep dive &gt;&gt; Okay. So, our mission for this deep dive is to really unpack what that shift

is to really unpack what that shift is to really unpack what that shift means. We're going to look at three means. We're going to look at three means. We're going to look at three massive things.

massive things. massive things. &gt;&gt; Let's lay them out. &gt;&gt; Let's lay them out.

&gt;&gt; Let's lay them out. &gt;&gt; First, this is apocalypse. And yes, that &gt;&gt; First, this is apocalypse. And yes, that &gt;&gt; First, this is apocalypse. And yes, that is a real term people are using.

is a real term people are using. is a real term people are using. &gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; It is.

&gt;&gt; It is. &gt;&gt; And the pricing collapse of that old &gt;&gt; And the pricing collapse of that old &gt;&gt; And the pricing collapse of that old model. Second, this what $600 billion model. Second, this what $600 billion model. Second, this what $600 billion plus infrastructure arms race and why

plus infrastructure arms race and why plus infrastructure arms race and why the big guys are betting the farm on it. the big guys are betting the farm on it.

the big guys are betting the farm on it. &gt;&gt; An existential bet really. &gt;&gt; An existential bet really. &gt;&gt; An existential bet really. &gt;&gt; And third, and I think this is the one &gt;&gt; And third, and I think this is the one &gt;&gt; And third, and I think this is the one that's not getting enough attention, the

that's not getting enough attention, the that's not getting enough attention, the hidden bomb. hidden bomb.

hidden bomb. the credit risks that are lurking in the credit risks that are lurking in the credit risks that are lurking in private equity.

private equity. private equity. &gt;&gt; That credit piece is absolutely crucial. &gt;&gt; That credit piece is absolutely crucial.

&gt;&gt; That credit piece is absolutely crucial. It's the invisible thread that could, It's the invisible thread that could, It's the invisible thread that could, you know, unravel the whole sweater if you know, unravel the whole sweater if you know, unravel the whole sweater if we aren't careful.

we aren't careful. we aren't careful. &gt;&gt; It's where the stock market bubble meets &gt;&gt; It's where the stock market bubble meets &gt;&gt; It's where the stock market bubble meets the real economy with real debt.

the real economy with real debt. the real economy with real debt. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Exactly.

&gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's unpack this. We have to &gt;&gt; Okay, let's unpack this. We have to &gt;&gt; Okay, let's unpack this. We have to start with the mechanics of the crash.

start with the mechanics of the crash. start with the mechanics of the crash. This is apocalypse. It sounds like a bad This is apocalypse. It sounds like a bad This is apocalypse. It sounds like a bad sci-fi movie, but sci-fi movie, but

sci-fi movie, but &gt;&gt; for investors in some of these &gt;&gt; for investors in some of these &gt;&gt; for investors in some of these companies, Salesforce, Workday, Legal companies, Salesforce, Workday, Legal companies, Salesforce, Workday, Legal Zoom, it's been a horror show.

Zoom, it's been a horror show. Zoom, it's been a horror show. &gt;&gt; So, what is actually breaking the model? &gt;&gt; So, what is actually breaking the model?

&gt;&gt; So, what is actually breaking the model? What's the fundamental flaw that just What's the fundamental flaw that just What's the fundamental flaw that just got exposed?

got exposed? got exposed? &gt;&gt; To understand why it's breaking, you &gt;&gt; To understand why it's breaking, you &gt;&gt; To understand why it's breaking, you have to understand how it was built.

have to understand how it was built. have to understand how it was built. It's actually quite simple. For the last It's actually quite simple. For the last It's actually quite simple. For the last 15, maybe 20 years, the entire software 15, maybe 20 years, the entire software

15, maybe 20 years, the entire software industry has been built on one single industry has been built on one single industry has been built on one single metric, metric, metric, &gt;&gt; which is

&gt;&gt; which is &gt;&gt; which is &gt;&gt; the seat. &gt;&gt; the seat.

&gt;&gt; the seat. &gt;&gt; The seat meaning you charge per person &gt;&gt; The seat meaning you charge per person &gt;&gt; The seat meaning you charge per person using the software.

using the software. using the software. &gt;&gt; Precisely. It's seatbased pricing. If &gt;&gt; Precisely. It's seatbased pricing. If &gt;&gt; Precisely. It's seatbased pricing. If you're Salesforce or workday or a sauna, you're Salesforce or workday or a sauna,

you're Salesforce or workday or a sauna, your revenue model is beautifully your revenue model is beautifully your revenue model is beautifully simple. You sell a subscription for simple. You sell a subscription for simple. You sell a subscription for every human employee at a company who

every human employee at a company who every human employee at a company who needs to log in and use your tool. needs to log in and use your tool.

needs to log in and use your tool. &gt;&gt; So if I'm a business and I hire a new &gt;&gt; So if I'm a business and I hire a new &gt;&gt; So if I'm a business and I hire a new salesperson, salesperson, salesperson, &gt;&gt; you need a new Salesforce seat, Ching.

&gt;&gt; you need a new Salesforce seat, Ching. &gt;&gt; you need a new Salesforce seat, Ching. &gt;&gt; I hire a new HR representative. &gt;&gt; I hire a new HR representative.

&gt;&gt; I hire a new HR representative. &gt;&gt; You need a new workday seat, Ching. &gt;&gt; You need a new workday seat, Ching. &gt;&gt; You need a new workday seat, Ching. &gt;&gt; So the growth of the software company is &gt;&gt; So the growth of the software company is &gt;&gt; So the growth of the software company is directly onetoone tied to the headcount

[4:02]

directly onetoone tied to the headcount directly onetoone tied to the headcount growth of their customers. growth of their customers.

growth of their customers. &gt;&gt; Exactly. More humans equals more money. &gt;&gt; Exactly. More humans equals more money. &gt;&gt; Exactly. More humans equals more money. &gt;&gt; And it was a fantastic model. It was &gt;&gt; And it was a fantastic model. It was &gt;&gt; And it was a fantastic model. It was predictable. It was scalable. Investors

predictable. It was scalable. Investors predictable. It was scalable. Investors absolutely loved it because as the absolutely loved it because as the absolutely loved it because as the economy grew and companies hired the SAS economy grew and companies hired the SAS

economy grew and companies hired the SAS revenue grew naturally. It was the revenue grew naturally. It was the revenue grew naturally. It was the ultimate compounder thesis.

ultimate compounder thesis. ultimate compounder thesis. &gt;&gt; But then something broke that link. &gt;&gt; But then something broke that link.

&gt;&gt; But then something broke that link. &gt;&gt; The link got severed and that's the &gt;&gt; The link got severed and that's the &gt;&gt; The link got severed and that's the disruption.

&gt;&gt; a direct substitute. We're seeing data now, and look, some of this is still now, and look, some of this is still now, and look, some of this is still theoretical, but it suggests one theoretical, but it suggests one theoretical, but it suggests one engineer equipped with these autonomous

engineer equipped with these autonomous engineer equipped with these autonomous AI agents can do the work of 18 AI agents can do the work of 18 AI agents can do the work of 18 engineers.

engineers. engineers. &gt;&gt; Wait, stop. 1818. &gt;&gt; Wait, stop. 1818.

&gt;&gt; Wait, stop. 1818. &gt;&gt; That's the number being floated for &gt;&gt; That's the number being floated for &gt;&gt; That's the number being floated for certain coding workflows.

a crazy multiplier. a crazy multiplier. &gt;&gt; It's definitely the high end of the &gt;&gt; It's definitely the high end of the &gt;&gt; It's definitely the high end of the theoretical efficiency gains. But let's theoretical efficiency gains. But let's

theoretical efficiency gains. But let's be conservative. Let's say it's not 18. be conservative. Let's say it's not 18. be conservative. Let's say it's not 18. Let's dial it way back. Say it's only Let's dial it way back. Say it's only Let's dial it way back. Say it's only 5:1 or even 3:1.

5:1 or even 3:1. 5:1 or even 3:1. &gt;&gt; Even 3:1 is a revolution. &gt;&gt; Even 3:1 is a revolution.

&gt;&gt; Even 3:1 is a revolution. &gt;&gt; It is. Now do the math on the death of &gt;&gt; It is. Now do the math on the death of &gt;&gt; It is. Now do the math on the death of the seat model. If a company can produce the seat model. If a company can produce the seat model. If a company can produce the same amount of work with say a third

the same amount of work with say a third the same amount of work with say a third of the engineers because the agents are of the engineers because the agents are of the engineers because the agents are doing the heavy lifting, what happens to doing the heavy lifting, what happens to

doing the heavy lifting, what happens to their software subscriptions? their software subscriptions? their software subscriptions? &gt;&gt; They plummet. You don't need 18 &gt;&gt; They plummet. You don't need 18 &gt;&gt; They plummet. You don't need 18 Salesforce licenses for your sales team

Salesforce licenses for your sales team Salesforce licenses for your sales team anymore. You might need one for the anymore. You might need one for the anymore. You might need one for the senior manager and then well do the senior manager and then well do the

senior manager and then well do the agents themselves need seats? agents themselves need seats? agents themselves need seats? &gt;&gt; And that is the problem. Currently, they &gt;&gt; And that is the problem. Currently, they &gt;&gt; And that is the problem. Currently, they usually don't. Or the pricing model is

usually don't. Or the pricing model is usually don't. Or the pricing model is completely different based on completely different based on completely different based on consumption, not a flat per head fee.

consumption, not a flat per head fee. consumption, not a flat per head fee. &gt;&gt; This is the cannibalization math that's &gt;&gt; This is the cannibalization math that's &gt;&gt; This is the cannibalization math that's freaking the market out. It is there is freaking the market out. It is there is

[6:04]

freaking the market out. It is there is a theoretical scenario where if a theoretical scenario where if a theoretical scenario where if companies fully adopt these agentic companies fully adopt these agentic companies fully adopt these agentic workflows, 94% of seatbased revenue

workflows, 94% of seatbased revenue workflows, 94% of seatbased revenue could be cannibalized. could be cannibalized.

could be cannibalized. &gt;&gt; 94%. &gt;&gt; 94%. &gt;&gt; 94%. &gt;&gt; Think about it. If an agent can &gt;&gt; Think about it. If an agent can &gt;&gt; Think about it. If an agent can completely replace a parallegal,

completely replace a parallegal, completely replace a parallegal, &gt;&gt; legal zoom loses that seat forever. &gt;&gt; legal zoom loses that seat forever.

&gt;&gt; legal zoom loses that seat forever. &gt;&gt; And this isn't some far-off future &gt;&gt; And this isn't some far-off future &gt;&gt; And this isn't some far-off future scenario anymore, is it? We saw this scenario anymore, is it? We saw this scenario anymore, is it? We saw this actually happen in real time just

actually happen in real time just actually happen in real time just recently. recently.

recently. &gt;&gt; The Claude Co-work moment. &gt;&gt; The Claude Co-work moment. &gt;&gt; The Claude Co-work moment. &gt;&gt; Yes, that was the flash crash that I &gt;&gt; Yes, that was the flash crash that I &gt;&gt; Yes, that was the flash crash that I think woke everyone up. So, Anthropic,

think woke everyone up. So, Anthropic, think woke everyone up. So, Anthropic, the AI company, they released these the AI company, they released these the AI company, they released these Claude Co-work plugins. Tell us what Claude Co-work plugins. Tell us what

Claude Co-work plugins. Tell us what they were. they were. they were. &gt;&gt; They weren't just a general purpose, &gt;&gt; They weren't just a general purpose, &gt;&gt; They weren't just a general purpose, hey, here's a better spell check. These

hey, here's a better spell check. These hey, here's a better spell check. These were plugins specifically designed for were plugins specifically designed for were plugins specifically designed for high value professional workflows, high value professional workflows,

high value professional workflows, legal, finance, sales, legal, finance, sales, legal, finance, sales, &gt;&gt; and the market reaction was not subtle.

&gt;&gt; and the market reaction was not subtle. &gt;&gt; and the market reaction was not subtle. &gt;&gt; It was instantaneous, and it was &gt;&gt; It was instantaneous, and it was &gt;&gt; It was instantaneous, and it was violent. Stocks like Legal Zoom, violent. Stocks like Legal Zoom,

violent. Stocks like Legal Zoom, Thompson, Reuters, Into, they took Thompson, Reuters, Into, they took Thompson, Reuters, Into, they took massive hits.

massive hits. massive hits. &gt;&gt; Some were down what, nearly 20% in a &gt;&gt; Some were down what, nearly 20% in a &gt;&gt; Some were down what, nearly 20% in a matter of days. That's right. Because matter of days. That's right. Because

matter of days. That's right. Because investors, the smart money, looked at investors, the smart money, looked at investors, the smart money, looked at that plugin and immediately understood that plugin and immediately understood that plugin and immediately understood the implications.

the implications. the implications. &gt;&gt; They said, "Wait a minute. This AI can &gt;&gt; They said, "Wait a minute. This AI can &gt;&gt; They said, "Wait a minute. This AI can read the legal files. It can organize read the legal files. It can organize

sauce companies is their dashboard, their user interface. The realization their user interface. The realization their user interface. The realization was that you don't need a specialized, was that you don't need a specialized, was that you don't need a specialized, expensive, clunky software dashboard. If

expensive, clunky software dashboard. If expensive, clunky software dashboard. If an intelligent agent can just go an intelligent agent can just go an intelligent agent can just go directly into your files, do the work, directly into your files, do the work,

directly into your files, do the work, and give you the finished product, and give you the finished product, and give you the finished product, &gt;&gt; the value of the tool just collapsed &gt;&gt; the value of the tool just collapsed &gt;&gt; the value of the tool just collapsed &gt;&gt; completely. It's like

&gt;&gt; completely. It's like &gt;&gt; completely. It's like &gt;&gt; if you hire a worldclass butler, you &gt;&gt; if you hire a worldclass butler, you &gt;&gt; if you hire a worldclass butler, you don't need to know how to operate the don't need to know how to operate the

don't need to know how to operate the washing machine anymore. washing machine anymore. washing machine anymore. &gt;&gt; That's a great analogy.

&gt;&gt; That's a great analogy. &gt;&gt; That's a great analogy. &gt;&gt; You just tell the butler, "Clean the &gt;&gt; You just tell the butler, "Clean the &gt;&gt; You just tell the butler, "Clean the clothes." You don't care how they do it.

clothes." You don't care how they do it. clothes." You don't care how they do it. &gt;&gt; And the tool era was all about selling &gt;&gt; And the tool era was all about selling &gt;&gt; And the tool era was all about selling us a better washing machine, us a better washing machine,

us a better washing machine, &gt;&gt; better knobs, better dials, a slicker &gt;&gt; better knobs, better dials, a slicker &gt;&gt; better knobs, better dials, a slicker user interface, more cycle options.

user interface, more cycle options. user interface, more cycle options. It was about making the tool easier for It was about making the tool easier for It was about making the tool easier for a human to use.

a human to use. a human to use. &gt;&gt; But the agentic era is about hiring the &gt;&gt; But the agentic era is about hiring the &gt;&gt; But the agentic era is about hiring the butler.

butler. butler. &gt;&gt; And if your entire business is selling &gt;&gt; And if your entire business is selling &gt;&gt; And if your entire business is selling washing machine instruction manuals, washing machine instruction manuals,

[8:04]

washing machine instruction manuals, which is what a lot of complex saws which is what a lot of complex saws which is what a lot of complex saws interfaces effectively are, interfaces effectively are, interfaces effectively are, &gt;&gt; you are in a world of trouble.

&gt;&gt; you are in a world of trouble. &gt;&gt; you are in a world of trouble. &gt;&gt; There's another layer to the &gt;&gt; There's another layer to the &gt;&gt; There's another layer to the cespocalypse that I found fascinating in cespocalypse that I found fascinating in

AI generates the code for you. AI generates the code for you. &gt;&gt; Okay, so let's play this out. Let's say &gt;&gt; Okay, so let's play this out. Let's say &gt;&gt; Okay, so let's play this out. Let's say I'm a small business and I'm paying, I I'm a small business and I'm paying, I

I'm a small business and I'm paying, I don't know, a million dollars a year for don't know, a million dollars a year for don't know, a million dollars a year for some specialized sauce product. Let's some specialized sauce product. Let's some specialized sauce product. Let's call it a niche CRM for uh dog walkers.

call it a niche CRM for uh dog walkers. call it a niche CRM for uh dog walkers. And I realize, hey, wait a minute. My And I realize, hey, wait a minute. My And I realize, hey, wait a minute. My internal IT team or even a smart intern internal IT team or even a smart intern

internal IT team or even a smart intern could just vibe code a clone of this could just vibe code a clone of this could just vibe code a clone of this thing in 3 weeks. What happens to the thing in 3 weeks. What happens to the thing in 3 weeks. What happens to the vendor's moat?

vendor's moat? vendor's moat? &gt;&gt; It's gone. It evaporates. &gt;&gt; It's gone. It evaporates.

&gt;&gt; It's gone. It evaporates. &gt;&gt; That is the crisis for these companies. &gt;&gt; That is the crisis for these companies. &gt;&gt; That is the crisis for these companies. The protective moat around their The protective moat around their The protective moat around their proprietary code, which took them years

proprietary code, which took them years proprietary code, which took them years and millions of dollars to build, is and millions of dollars to build, is and millions of dollars to build, is just just

just &gt;&gt; disappearing. &gt;&gt; disappearing. &gt;&gt; disappearing. &gt;&gt; And we're seeing this in the data.

&gt;&gt; And we're seeing this in the data. &gt;&gt; And we're seeing this in the data. &gt;&gt; We are we're seeing stats that something &gt;&gt; We are we're seeing stats that something &gt;&gt; We are we're seeing stats that something like 4% of all code on GitHub is already like 4% of all code on GitHub is already

like 4% of all code on GitHub is already AI generated. And that number is going AI generated. And that number is going AI generated. And that number is going vertical. So if a competitor or even vertical. So if a competitor or even vertical. So if a competitor or even your own internal team can spin up a

your own internal team can spin up a your own internal team can spin up a good enough clone of a proprietary sauce good enough clone of a proprietary sauce good enough clone of a proprietary sauce product in weeks instead of years, what product in weeks instead of years, what

[10:08]

and the agentic era is taking its place, we need to define that shift a bit more we need to define that shift a bit more we need to define that shift a bit more clearly for people. We use the butler clearly for people. We use the butler clearly for people. We use the butler analogy,

analogy, analogy, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; right?

&gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But in market terms, this is really the &gt;&gt; But in market terms, this is really the &gt;&gt; But in market terms, this is really the shift from SAS to POS, isn't it? From shift from SAS to POS, isn't it? From shift from SAS to POS, isn't it? From software as a service to platform as a

software as a service to platform as a software as a service to platform as a service. service.

very efficiently reallocating capital. very efficiently reallocating capital. It's fleeing the tools and it is pouring It's fleeing the tools and it is pouring It's fleeing the tools and it is pouring into the platforms.

into the platforms. into the platforms. &gt;&gt; And the winner or at least the perceived &gt;&gt; And the winner or at least the perceived &gt;&gt; And the winner or at least the perceived winner right now is a company we have to winner right now is a company we have to

winner right now is a company we have to talk about, Palanteer. talk about, Palanteer. talk about, Palanteer. &gt;&gt; Palanteer. They're being called the &gt;&gt; Palanteer. They're being called the &gt;&gt; Palanteer. They're being called the messy of AI in some of these reports,

messy of AI in some of these reports, messy of AI in some of these reports, &gt;&gt; which you know is about as high praise &gt;&gt; which you know is about as high praise &gt;&gt; which you know is about as high praise as you can get.

as you can get. as you can get. &gt;&gt; It is, but you have to look at the &gt;&gt; It is, but you have to look at the &gt;&gt; It is, but you have to look at the numbers to understand why. They posted numbers to understand why. They posted

numbers to understand why. They posted 142% revenue growth in their US 142% revenue growth in their US 142% revenue growth in their US commercial markets.

commercial markets. commercial markets. &gt;&gt; 142%. &gt;&gt; 142%.

&gt;&gt; 142%. &gt;&gt; For a company of their size in this &gt;&gt; For a company of their size in this &gt;&gt; For a company of their size in this environment, that is just unheard of.

environment, that is just unheard of. environment, that is just unheard of. It's a staggering number. It's a staggering number.

It's a staggering number. &gt;&gt; So why them? Why is Palanteer not just &gt;&gt; So why them? Why is Palanteer not just &gt;&gt; So why them? Why is Palanteer not just surviving but thriving in this surviving but thriving in this surviving but thriving in this apocalypse when a company like

apocalypse when a company like apocalypse when a company like Salesforce is struggling? Is it just Salesforce is struggling? Is it just Salesforce is struggling? Is it just government contracts and hype?

government contracts and hype? government contracts and hype? &gt;&gt; No, it's architectural. It's about what &gt;&gt; No, it's architectural. It's about what &gt;&gt; No, it's architectural. It's about what they actually sell. Palanteer isn't they actually sell. Palanteer isn't

they actually sell. Palanteer isn't selling you a tool. selling you a tool. selling you a tool. &gt;&gt; They're not selling a better &gt;&gt; They're not selling a better &gt;&gt; They're not selling a better spreadsheet.

infrastructure that the butler lives in. infrastructure that the butler lives in. You could say they're selling the house You could say they're selling the house You could say they're selling the house for the butler or more accurately for the butler or more accurately

for the butler or more accurately they're selling the blueprint of the they're selling the blueprint of the they're selling the blueprint of the house.

house. house. &gt;&gt; Okay, what does that mean? &gt;&gt; Okay, what does that mean?

&gt;&gt; Okay, what does that mean? &gt;&gt; They're selling the ontology. Now, &gt;&gt; They're selling the ontology. Now, &gt;&gt; They're selling the ontology. Now, ontology is a bit of a jargon word. So, ontology is a bit of a jargon word. So, ontology is a bit of a jargon word. So, let's define it

let's define it let's define it &gt;&gt; please. &gt;&gt; please.

&gt;&gt; please. &gt;&gt; In data science, an ontology is &gt;&gt; In data science, an ontology is &gt;&gt; In data science, an ontology is essentially the map of how everything in essentially the map of how everything in essentially the map of how everything in your business relates to everything

your business relates to everything your business relates to everything else. It's the system that defines that else. It's the system that defines that else. It's the system that defines that a customer is a person who connects to a customer is a person who connects to

a customer is a person who connects to an order which then connects to a an order which then connects to a an order which then connects to a specific product which is built in a specific product which is built in a specific product which is built in a certain factory.

certain factory. certain factory. &gt;&gt; Okay. So it's the underlying logic of &gt;&gt; Okay. So it's the underlying logic of &gt;&gt; Okay. So it's the underlying logic of the business codified.

the business codified. the business codified. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Most companies even huge ones &gt;&gt; Exactly. Most companies even huge ones &gt;&gt; Exactly. Most companies even huge ones have a complete data mess. They have have a complete data mess. They have

have a complete data mess. They have data in 50 different silos in a hundred data in 50 different silos in a hundred data in 50 different silos in a hundred different formats. An AI agent is different formats. An AI agent is different formats. An AI agent is completely useless if it doesn't know

[12:10]

completely useless if it doesn't know completely useless if it doesn't know what all that data means or how it what all that data means or how it what all that data means or how it connects.

&gt;&gt; It's garbage in garbage out. &gt;&gt; Precisely. Palanteer comes in and &gt;&gt; Precisely. Palanteer comes in and &gt;&gt; Precisely. Palanteer comes in and provides that meaning. They create the provides that meaning. They create the provides that meaning. They create the digital twin of the business.

digital twin of the business. digital twin of the business. &gt;&gt; So when an agent asks, "How many widgets &gt;&gt; So when an agent asks, "How many widgets &gt;&gt; So when an agent asks, "How many widgets did we sell in Ohio last quarter?" did we sell in Ohio last quarter?"

did we sell in Ohio last quarter?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It gets a real answer. &gt;&gt; It gets a real answer.

&gt;&gt; It gets a real answer. &gt;&gt; They are a Patty play as a service. They &gt;&gt; They are a Patty play as a service. They &gt;&gt; They are a Patty play as a service. They are enabling the agentic shift, not are enabling the agentic shift, not are enabling the agentic shift, not getting replaced by it.

getting replaced by it. getting replaced by it. &gt;&gt; That makes sense. And it brings us to &gt;&gt; That makes sense. And it brings us to &gt;&gt; That makes sense. And it brings us to the other big buzzword in this section the other big buzzword in this section

the other big buzzword in this section of the research, orchestration layers. of the research, orchestration layers. of the research, orchestration layers. Because if we have all these agents Because if we have all these agents Because if we have all these agents running around doing tasks, legal

running around doing tasks, legal running around doing tasks, legal agents, coding agents, HR agents, it agents, coding agents, HR agents, it agents, coding agents, HR agents, it sounds like potential chaos.

sounds like potential chaos. sounds like potential chaos. &gt;&gt; It is absolute chaos if it's not managed &gt;&gt; It is absolute chaos if it's not managed &gt;&gt; It is absolute chaos if it's not managed properly. I mean, think about it. If you properly. I mean, think about it. If you

properly. I mean, think about it. If you have a thousand autonomous agents have a thousand autonomous agents have a thousand autonomous agents executing tasks across your company, who executing tasks across your company, who executing tasks across your company, who is watching them?

is watching them? is watching them? &gt;&gt; Who makes sure the legal agent doesn't &gt;&gt; Who makes sure the legal agent doesn't &gt;&gt; Who makes sure the legal agent doesn't promise a contract term that the finance promise a contract term that the finance

promise a contract term that the finance agent can't possibly deliver on? agent can't possibly deliver on? agent can't possibly deliver on? &gt;&gt; Exactly. Who manages the managers? Who &gt;&gt; Exactly. Who manages the managers? Who &gt;&gt; Exactly. Who manages the managers? Who is the conductor of the orchestra? This

is the conductor of the orchestra? This is the conductor of the orchestra? This is where the concept of the platform of is where the concept of the platform of is where the concept of the platform of platforms comes in and this is the big platforms comes in and this is the big

platforms comes in and this is the big bet that a company like service now is bet that a company like service now is bet that a company like service now is making making making &gt;&gt; a huge pivot for them.

&gt;&gt; a huge pivot for them. &gt;&gt; a huge pivot for them. &gt;&gt; So service now or no they are trying &gt;&gt; So service now or no they are trying &gt;&gt; So service now or no they are trying very hard to become this this control very hard to become this this control

very hard to become this this control tower for all the agents. tower for all the agents. tower for all the agents. &gt;&gt; They are their CEO Bill McDermott has &gt;&gt; They are their CEO Bill McDermott has &gt;&gt; They are their CEO Bill McDermott has been extremely vocal about this. Their

been extremely vocal about this. Their been extremely vocal about this. Their entire argument is that agents need entire argument is that agents need entire argument is that agents need governance.

governance. governance. &gt;&gt; They need rules. They need rules and &gt;&gt; They need rules. They need rules and &gt;&gt; They need rules. They need rules and they need what's called a semantic they need what's called a semantic

they need what's called a semantic layer, which is just a fancy way of layer, which is just a fancy way of layer, which is just a fancy way of saying a single source of truth.

saying a single source of truth. saying a single source of truth. &gt;&gt; So, you can't have an agent just making &gt;&gt; So, you can't have an agent just making &gt;&gt; So, you can't have an agent just making up a price for a customer, up a price for a customer,

up a price for a customer, &gt;&gt; right? It has to pull that price from a &gt;&gt; right? It has to pull that price from a &gt;&gt; right? It has to pull that price from a verified up-to-date database. It needs verified up-to-date database. It needs verified up-to-date database. It needs guard rails to prevent hallucinations or

&gt;&gt; they are having intense flashbacks to the late '9s to the telecom bubble. the late '9s to the telecom bubble. the late '9s to the telecom bubble. &gt;&gt; The dark fiber trauma. It seared into &gt;&gt; The dark fiber trauma. It seared into &gt;&gt; The dark fiber trauma. It seared into the memory of a generation of investors.

the memory of a generation of investors. the memory of a generation of investors. &gt;&gt; Okay. So remind us what happened there &gt;&gt; Okay. So remind us what happened there &gt;&gt; Okay. So remind us what happened there because a lot of our listeners might because a lot of our listeners might

because a lot of our listeners might know the term but they might not know the term but they might not know the term but they might not remember the mechanics of why it blew up remember the mechanics of why it blew up remember the mechanics of why it blew up so spectacularly.

so spectacularly. so spectacularly. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. So in the late '9s the &gt;&gt; Right. Right. So in the late '9s the &gt;&gt; Right. Right. So in the late '9s the thesis was that internet traffic was thesis was that internet traffic was

thesis was that internet traffic was going to double every hundred days going to double every hundred days going to double every hundred days forever forever forever &gt;&gt; which seemed plausible at the time.

&gt;&gt; which seemed plausible at the time. &gt;&gt; which seemed plausible at the time. &gt;&gt; It was the field of dreams era of &gt;&gt; It was the field of dreams era of &gt;&gt; It was the field of dreams era of investing.

investing. investing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Build it and they will come. So telecom &gt;&gt; Build it and they will come. So telecom &gt;&gt; Build it and they will come. So telecom companies, WorldCom, Global Crossing,

companies, WorldCom, Global Crossing, companies, WorldCom, Global Crossing, they raised and spent billions of they raised and spent billions of they raised and spent billions of dollars laying fiber optic cables across dollars laying fiber optic cables across

internet that didn't quite exist yet. internet that didn't quite exist yet. &gt;&gt; Exactly. And then the traffic didn't &gt;&gt; Exactly. And then the traffic didn't &gt;&gt; Exactly. And then the traffic didn't grow that fast. The demand wasn't there grow that fast. The demand wasn't there

doing the exact same thing all over again. We're building dark data centers. again. We're building dark data centers. again. We're building dark data centers. for buying millions of Nvidia chips that for buying millions of Nvidia chips that for buying millions of Nvidia chips that are just going to sit there consuming

&gt;&gt; the bullcase. &gt;&gt; The one led by people like Kathy Wood at &gt;&gt; The one led by people like Kathy Wood at &gt;&gt; The one led by people like Kathy Wood at ARK and of course Jensen Huang at ARK and of course Jensen Huang at ARK and of course Jensen Huang at Nvidia.

Nvidia. Nvidia. &gt;&gt; The alive assets argument. &gt;&gt; The alive assets argument.

&gt;&gt; The alive assets argument. &gt;&gt; Okay. What does that mean? &gt;&gt; Okay. What does that mean? &gt;&gt; Okay. What does that mean? &gt;&gt; Yes. They argued that 2026 is &gt;&gt; Yes. They argued that 2026 is &gt;&gt; Yes. They argued that 2026 is fundamentally different from the year

fundamentally different from the year fundamentally different from the year 2000. When you laid a piece of fiber 2000. When you laid a piece of fiber 2000. When you laid a piece of fiber optic cable, it was a passive asset. It optic cable, it was a passive asset. It

crazy like 12:1. crazy like 12:1. &gt;&gt; That's the number being reported. So &gt;&gt; That's the number being reported. So &gt;&gt; That's the number being reported. So unlike the fiber which was built and unlike the fiber which was built and

unlike the fiber which was built and then waited for customers, here you have then waited for customers, here you have then waited for customers, here you have the customers literally banging on the the customers literally banging on the the customers literally banging on the door fighting over the limited supply of

humanly possible. &gt;&gt; That's the difference. And there's &gt;&gt; That's the difference. And there's &gt;&gt; That's the difference. And there's another key distinction here between another key distinction here between another key distinction here between training compute and inference compute.

training compute and inference compute. training compute and inference compute. This is important. This is important.

stop. &gt;&gt; Exactly. The bear case is that training &gt;&gt; Exactly. The bear case is that training &gt;&gt; Exactly. The bear case is that training is a one-time thing, but the bulls are is a one-time thing, but the bulls are is a one-time thing, but the bulls are focused on inference. Inference is the

focused on inference. Inference is the focused on inference. Inference is the brain actually thinking. answering a brain actually thinking. answering a brain actually thinking. answering a question, writing a piece of code, question, writing a piece of code,

argument is that as we move into the argument is that as we move into the agentic era, the demand for inference agentic era, the demand for inference agentic era, the demand for inference for billions of agents doing trillions for billions of agents doing trillions

for billions of agents doing trillions of tasks every day is going to explode of tasks every day is going to explode of tasks every day is going to explode exponentially. It will dwarf the amount exponentially. It will dwarf the amount exponentially. It will dwarf the amount of compute we used for training.

of compute we used for training. of compute we used for training. &gt;&gt; And this is what Dan Ice calls an arms &gt;&gt; And this is what Dan Ice calls an arms &gt;&gt; And this is what Dan Ice calls an arms race, right? This spending isn't race, right? This spending isn't

clog forming in the world of private equity. equity. equity. &gt;&gt; The LBO trap.

&gt;&gt; The LBO trap. &gt;&gt; The LBO trap. &gt;&gt; LBO, leverage buyout. Let's break down &gt;&gt; LBO, leverage buyout. Let's break down &gt;&gt; LBO, leverage buyout. Let's break down the setup. For the last decade, with the setup. For the last decade, with

the setup. For the last decade, with interest rates near zero, private equity interest rates near zero, private equity interest rates near zero, private equity firms, the big PE shots, have been on a firms, the big PE shots, have been on a firms, the big PE shots, have been on a buying spree.

buying spree. buying spree. &gt;&gt; And what were they buying? &gt;&gt; And what were they buying?

&gt;&gt; And what were they buying? &gt;&gt; They were buying a boring, stable B2B &gt;&gt; They were buying a boring, stable B2B &gt;&gt; They were buying a boring, stable B2B software companies. The lazy saws software companies. The lazy saws software companies. The lazy saws companies we just defined.

companies we just defined. companies we just defined. &gt;&gt; Exactly. They bought them because the &gt;&gt; Exactly. They bought them because the &gt;&gt; Exactly. They bought them because the cash flow is seen as incredibly cash flow is seen as incredibly

cash flow is seen as incredibly predictable. You have seats. You have predictable. You have seats. You have predictable. You have seats. You have recurring subscriptions. You have money recurring subscriptions. You have money recurring subscriptions. You have money coming in the door every month like

coming in the door every month like coming in the door every month like clockwork. clockwork.

clockwork. &gt;&gt; So they took these cash cow companies &gt;&gt; So they took these cash cow companies &gt;&gt; So they took these cash cow companies &gt;&gt; and they loaded them up with enormous &gt;&gt; and they loaded them up with enormous &gt;&gt; and they loaded them up with enormous amounts of debt to complete the

amounts of debt to complete the amounts of debt to complete the purchase. That's the leveraged part of purchase. That's the leveraged part of purchase. That's the leveraged part of the LBO.

the LBO. the LBO. &gt;&gt; They used the company's own credit card &gt;&gt; They used the company's own credit card &gt;&gt; They used the company's own credit card to buy the company.

to buy the company. to buy the company. &gt;&gt; That's a great way to put it. And they &gt;&gt; That's a great way to put it. And they &gt;&gt; That's a great way to put it. And they paid huge, huge premiums. The research paid huge, huge premiums. The research

paid huge, huge premiums. The research shows they were buying these companies shows they were buying these companies shows they were buying these companies at valuations of roughly 20 times EBITa.

at valuations of roughly 20 times EBITa. at valuations of roughly 20 times EBITa. &gt;&gt; 20 times earnings. That is priced for &gt;&gt; 20 times earnings. That is priced for &gt;&gt; 20 times earnings. That is priced for perfection. That assumes everything goes perfection. That assumes everything goes

perfection. That assumes everything goes right forever. right forever. right forever. &gt;&gt; It is it's a valuation that leaves zero &gt;&gt; It is it's a valuation that leaves zero &gt;&gt; It is it's a valuation that leaves zero room for error. Yeah.

[22:19]

room for error. Yeah. room for error. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the entire underwriting assumption &gt;&gt; And the entire underwriting assumption &gt;&gt; And the entire underwriting assumption was this company will grow its revenue was this company will grow its revenue

was this company will grow its revenue 10 15% a year. Every year forever. 10 15% a year. Every year forever. 10 15% a year. Every year forever. Because companies always need to hire Because companies always need to hire Because companies always need to hire more people and buy more software seats.

more people and buy more software seats. more people and buy more software seats. &gt;&gt; And then this apocalypse happens. The &gt;&gt; And then this apocalypse happens. The &gt;&gt; And then this apocalypse happens. The music stops. the seats stop growing. In music stops. the seats stop growing. In

music stops. the seats stop growing. In fact, for some of them, they start fact, for some of them, they start fact, for some of them, they start shrinking because of AIdriven shrinking because of AIdriven shrinking because of AIdriven efficiency. The growth slows to a crawl

or even goes negative. &gt;&gt; So now you have a company that is &gt;&gt; So now you have a company that is &gt;&gt; So now you have a company that is carrying a massive debt load that was carrying a massive debt load that was carrying a massive debt load that was bought with the expectation of high

bought with the expectation of high bought with the expectation of high growth and that growth is just not growth and that growth is just not growth and that growth is just not there. What are these companies actually there. What are these companies actually

there. What are these companies actually worth now in the open market? worth now in the open market? worth now in the open market? &gt;&gt; Well, the market is now clearing these &gt;&gt; Well, the market is now clearing these &gt;&gt; Well, the market is now clearing these types of businesses at maybe 9A

types of businesses at maybe 9A types of businesses at maybe 9A if they're lucky. Oof. So you bought it if they're lucky. Oof. So you bought it if they're lucky. Oof. So you bought it at 20x and now it's worth 9x. That is a at 20x and now it's worth 9x. That is a
