[00:02] If you're new to Cloud Code, this video is for you. I'm going to share the tips
[00:04] and tricks I wish I knew about Cloud
[00:05] Code before I started building with it.
[00:08] So, you're going to have a big head
[00:09] start over people who are just jumping
[00:11] in. Clog Code can seem intimidating at
[00:14] first because it's just in your
[00:15] terminal. This video is going to make it
[00:17] really easy for you to understand all of
[00:19] those tips and tricks and get started.
[00:21] Tip number one of Cloud Code is slash
[00:24] commands. If you're inside the terminal
[00:26] with clawed code set up and you do a
[00:28] slash, you can see all of the different
[00:30] commands that you have available to you.
[00:32] So, the next few tips are going to be
[00:34] what I find the most valuable slash
[00:37] commands that you need to know about,
[00:39] but there are a lot here for you to
[00:41] explore. So, let's go ahead to tip
[00:43] number two, which is the compact slash
[00:45] command. If you don't know about this,
[00:48] as your chat window gets really long,
[00:51] let's say you're chatting with Claude a
[00:52] lot, that is using a lot of context and
[00:56] tokens as you're chatting. So, if you
[00:58] have a really long chat window, but you
[01:00] want to clear conversation history, but
[01:02] keep a summary in the context, all you
[01:04] have to do is do slash compact. And then
[01:06] if you want, you can even give an
[01:08] optional custom summarization
[01:10] instructions to be like focus a lot on X
[01:13] or whatever you specifically want it to
[01:15] summarize and do a really good job at.
[01:17] So compact I find is really helpful. The
[01:21] next one that I find really helpful is
[01:23] security review. This is going to
[01:25] complete a security review of the
[01:26] pending changes on the current branch.
[01:28] This is really helpful. I think this is
[01:29] one of the trends of 2026 with vibe
[01:31] coding is security. This is going to
[01:35] help make sure that your app is secure.
[01:36] Now, you also can always just ask Claw
[01:39] to do a security review for you, but
[01:41] that's a nice slash command that I
[01:43] recommend checking out. So, the third
[01:45] tip that you need to know about is the
[01:46] agents slash command. Now, this is going
[01:49] to be a little bit more advanced. I'm
[01:50] going to talk a little bit longer about
[01:52] the agents feature. Agents are
[01:54] specialized sub agents that Claude can
[01:56] delegate tasks to. You can think of them
[01:58] almost like employees. Agents are
[02:01] different from skills. I'm going to talk
[02:02] about skills a little bit later in this
[02:04] video. So agents, you think of it as its
[02:07] own employee. They have their own
[02:09] context window, their own custom system
[02:10] prompt, and their own specific tools.
[02:13] You can use the agent subcomand to
[02:15] create a new agent. We can create a new
[02:17] one. Right now, we can generate it with
[02:19] Claude. And I'm going to do this to show
[02:21] you exactly what it's like. Let's say I
[02:23] want a marketer who can help me write
[02:27] amazing brand copy. And just off of
[02:31] that, it's going to create an agent
[02:32] which is going to have a description and
[02:34] a basically context instructions, custom
[02:38] instructions on what is she did. Then at
[02:40] any time you are working in Claude,
[02:43] let's say you're building a landing page
[02:44] and you want to have really amazing copy
[02:46] for that landing page, you can invoke
[02:49] that agent. Just literally ask Claude,
[02:51] hey, we have an agent that we've created
[02:54] called the marketing copy agent. So we
[02:56] can create a new agent. You can decide
[02:58] what tools you need. So we'll just say
[03:00] for example, why don't we do readonly
[03:03] tools and then hit continue. You can
[03:05] decide how much power you want. Sauna
[03:07] opus haiku and hit from parent. I'm
[03:09] going to say opus and then you can give
[03:11] it a color. Let's say purple. So there
[03:14] we go. That's it. We can just save it.
[03:15] So now we have an agent brand
[03:17] copywriter. Anytime you want you can do
[03:19] slash agents and then access the agents
[03:21] here. So what's great about agents, I
[03:24] can actually exit. Just a little
[03:25] shortcut. You can always hit exit to get
[03:27] back to basically the chat. Let's say
[03:30] you have a whole chat going. You have a
[03:31] landing page as as I was mentioning
[03:33] before. You could say use the agent
[03:35] brand copyriter or you wouldn't even
[03:37] have to specifically write it out like
[03:39] that to generate five headline ideas for
[03:42] a coffee shop website. So I'll do that.
[03:45] And what you're going to see is it's
[03:47] going to pull up the sub agent. It's
[03:49] going to show in a different color. And
[03:50] it's basically here working in its own
[03:53] context window. So you could have a
[03:54] whole long chat. This is think of it
[03:56] almost as an employee going off and
[03:59] working in its own space and then coming
[04:01] back and giving you an idea. Now you can
[04:04] have multiple agents, sub aents working
[04:06] at the same time. I could even spin up
[04:08] multiple brand copywriter sub aents to
[04:11] to work at the same time. And then here
[04:13] we have five headline ideas for your
[04:14] coffee shop website. The agent also
[04:16] noted for cozy do two or five. Craft
[04:18] forward one or four. Bold do three simp.
[04:20] Just a really really powerful feature.
[04:22] You can have a UXUI agent. You can have
[04:24] a planning agent. You can have all sorts
[04:27] of agents. You can even ask Claude,
[04:28] "What kind of agents do you recommend I
[04:30] create?" So, there's a lot that you can
[04:31] do with agents. That's a really powerful
[04:34] one to know about. So, that brings me to
[04:37] my next tip. Tip number four. So, if we
[04:40] are writing a prompt tip that you can do
[04:43] is type ultra think. Now, you can use
[04:45] this anytime you want. When you do that,
[04:47] Claude changes the the design to like
[04:50] this rainbow color here.
[04:52] And that is just going to make Claude
[04:54] think a little bit harder. Now, you
[04:56] don't have to do anything but that. It's
[04:58] just going to think harder and basically
[05:01] give you use more tokens to to give you
[05:04] a more well thoughtout result. So, tip
[05:06] number four is to use ultraink. That's a
[05:08] really quick one. Tip number five that I
[05:11] want to talk about next are skills. So,
[05:13] I'm going to go down to skills. Now, you
[05:16] could also just start typing skills and
[05:18] that's going to list available skills
[05:20] that we have. So by default I have a
[05:22] front-end design skill or not by default
[05:25] a skill that I already added is the
[05:27] front end design skill skill. So skills
[05:28] are going to show you what skills you
[05:30] have. Just going to list them. Now the
[05:32] plugin if you do /plugins you can manage
[05:36] clog code plugin. So that's basically
[05:38] skills that you can download that other
[05:40] people have created which is what I did
[05:42] with that front-end design. But what's
[05:44] great about skills is they can be used
[05:45] across all of your cloud code instances
[05:48] and you can create either download them
[05:51] from other people or you can create them
[05:53] yourself. So I could say create a skill
[05:55] that is a YouTube title generator using
[05:57] best practices of YouTube titles. So you
[05:59] can just create skills inside of Claude.
[06:02] You also could potentially just create a
[06:03] markdown file outside of Claude and
[06:05] upload it to your Claude skills folder.
[06:07] But I think this is like the easiest way
[06:09] to do it. So, it's going to create a
[06:10] clause ghost directory and add a YouTube
[06:13] title generator skill. So, it's going to
[06:15] create that YouTube title generator
[06:17] skill and then I'm going to show you how
[06:18] to invoke it and then also why it's a
[06:21] little bit different from agents and sub
[06:23] aents. So, sub agents are working on
[06:25] their own context window, their own
[06:26] custom instructions. Skills are going to
[06:29] work within the context window that
[06:31] you're already in and you can stack them
[06:33] and you could have multiple skills
[06:35] working at the same time. So here it
[06:37] created the skill as you can see core
[06:40] principles title formulas that work etc.
[06:43] I could also ask it to make changes but
[06:45] I'm just going to say yes. Let's go
[06:46] ahead and create that skill. So then
[06:48] just like that now we have a skill
[06:50] inside of cloud code that you can use
[06:52] anytime you want. And then as I
[06:53] mentioned you can stack them. So let's
[06:55] say you have a title generator skill and
[06:57] you have a script generator skill. You
[07:00] could have it put those together and
[07:01] then it would invoke those separately.
[07:02] So there's two different skills that can
[07:04] work together in one workflow. So that's
[07:06] a really important tip. Tip number five,
[07:08] definitely you should know about skills
[07:11] and also agents. The next tip that you
[07:13] need to know about is planning. So let's
[07:15] say you're in cloud code, you want to
[07:17] build a web app that measures my
[07:21] workouts. Something simple. Now you
[07:23] could just send this off, but there's a
[07:25] really helpful feature called plan mode.
[07:27] So if we do shift tab, that's a
[07:29] shortcut. We can switch to plan mode on.
[07:32] You can also cycle through to turn it
[07:34] off. Now with plan mode on, we could
[07:36] send that off and it is going to plan
[07:40] out the app without actually creating it
[07:42] first. So it's going to say it's happy
[07:44] to build us one. Let's see what's in the
[07:45] directory and then ask us questions to
[07:47] understand what we're looking for. So
[07:49] basically the nice thing about plan mode
[07:51] is it's going to talk to us and it's not
[07:53] going to actually write code until we
[07:55] accept the plan. So we can see here it's
[07:58] going to ask questions. It has workout
[07:59] type, features, text, stack, data
[08:01] storage and then submit. Then at that
[08:03] point it would start actually building
[08:04] the app. So strength training, cardio,
[08:06] both for example. You can also do slash
[08:08] command and then do plan to enable plan
[08:11] mode. Plan mode's already on so we don't
[08:13] have to do anything there. But plan mode
[08:15] number six really helpful that you
[08:17] should know how to do. Tip number seven
[08:18] is that you can use claude inside of
[08:20] IDE. Here I have claude running inside
[08:23] of a terminal inside of cursor inside of
[08:26] this folder. I created a folder called
[08:27] tutorial claude code. So, Claude has
[08:30] access to all the files in this folder
[08:31] and can create files in the folder. So,
[08:34] I'm using cursor. I'm not actually using
[08:35] the cursor agent. Now, I could if I want
[08:37] to, and you could use them both in
[08:39] tandem, which can be helpful sometimes,
[08:42] but here I've really built this app
[08:44] fully with with clog code. And what it
[08:47] did is it built the web app. It has all
[08:50] the files here. What's nice about using
[08:52] the IDE specifically is if I'm just in
[08:54] the terminal, I can't easily see all the
[08:56] files and the code and go into it
[08:59] directly if I want to. Whereas here with
[09:02] but in cursor, I actually can go in and
[09:04] easily see all the code that's written.
[09:07] It's just a little bit better of a way
[09:09] to actually build apps and write code
[09:10] and and really I think just a better way
[09:12] to use cloud code in general because it
[09:15] makes it really easy to see what's
[09:17] inside of the folders or check like the
[09:20] plan file for example. There's a lot
[09:22] that we could do. So that's a really
[09:23] helpful tip. The next tip that you
[09:25] should know about is the claude.md file.
[09:28] So this is a mark md stands for
[09:30] markdown. It's just a markdown file.
[09:32] It's a special file that Claude will use
[09:34] to automatically pull in context when
[09:36] starting a conversation. So, this is
[09:38] something that you would basically add
[09:40] here to your folder. So, I could create
[09:43] a new file and call it claude.md. And
[09:45] then in here, we could type custom
[09:48] instructions that the claude agent is
[09:51] going to always look at when it's
[09:54] working with you. So, this could include
[09:55] code styles, workflow. So, for example,
[09:58] be sure to do type check when you're
[09:59] done making a series of code changes.
[10:01] There's a lot that you can do and put
[10:04] inside of cloud code or inside of the
[10:06] claw.md file for cloud code to look at.
[10:09] So this is definitely something that you
[10:10] should be aware of and and know that it
[10:12] can do. And if you want, you could even
[10:14] just ask it, hey, put X, Y, and Z into a
[10:18] claude.md file. So you could just have
[10:21] it do it. You don't have to even do it
[10:23] manually if you want. There's also some
[10:25] nice claw.md files available on GitHub
[10:27] that other people have put out publicly
[10:28] that you could check out. The last tip I
[10:30] recommend is checking out the Clawude
[10:32] Code documentation. This video covered
[10:35] the basic tips to get you started and
[10:37] things that I think will be helpful for
[10:38] you to make sure you understand, but
[10:40] there's so much in the documentation
[10:42] that I don't have time to cover in this
[10:44] video that's going to help you get the
[10:45] most out of Claude Code. So, you can
[10:47] definitely just jump into Claw Code and
[10:49] start building with what I shared, but
[10:50] you can also go into the documentation
[10:52] and just read everything in more detail
[10:54] and make sure that you're getting the
[10:56] absolute most out of Clawed Code. So,
[10:58] this is a really great resource and it's
[11:00] a tip that I keep going back to to learn
[11:02] more about cla code and how to use it. I
