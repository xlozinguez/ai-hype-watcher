I used Opus 4.6 to build in 10 minutes what it takes a Goldman analyst to build in a day. I'm not a Goldman analyst. And then I built a board deck for that in just 20 more minutes. General intelligence just showed up in Excel and PowerPoint and its name is Claude. I built a full operating model last week. Revenue projections, cost structure, unit economics, the works. And that just took a few minutes. And after that, Claude in PowerPoint took over and built slides, executive summaries, financials, key metrics using an actual slide deck
[00:30]
template. Just a few minutes later, I had a presentation with charts referencing live Excel data formatted in the correct fonts and colors. And this is something that would have taken a couple of days just a few months ago. And yes, I did mean it about Goldman. A Goldman Sachs analyst looked at the model and told me it was solid. It's the kind of output that would have probably taken him a day to build. and it took me 30 minutes total with a deck included. This is the piece of the week's news that most people are going to sleep on because it doesn't have the drama of a
[01:00]
benchmark score. It doesn't have the spectacle of 16 agents building a compiler or an agent managing 50 developers. This is just Excel, right? It's just PowerPoint. The tools nobody thinks about twice. And yet, we spend our days there. And as of this week, effectively, they have general intelligence inside them. The same intelligence that built that C compiler, the same intelligence that found 500 zeroday vulnerabilities on its own after security researchers had passed the code as secure. And here's the point that should really stop you. It's not about a
[01:32]
single product release. I don't care if you think Opus 4.6 is the sauce or not. The point is that this ship into Excel and PowerPoint paves the way 4.7 and then 5.0. It's not that the applications are going to change. PowerPoint will look the same. Excel will look the same, but the intelligence inside them is going to compound. This is the dumbest Excel and PowerPoint will ever be. Now, I covered Opus 4.6 in a separate piece earlier this week. What the model can
[02:02]
do, why it matters. I talked a lot about agents. This is about what happens when that intelligence shows up out billion people use every single day and why it turns Microsoft into just a dumb pipe and what that means for how you think about work when your tools are getting smarter faster than you can update your assumptions about them. So what actually shipped? Two things happened in the past couple of weeks and taken together they represent something bigger than either one of them by
[02:33]
themselves. On January 24th, Anthropic opened Claude and Excel to pro subscribers. Anyone paying 20 bucks a month or more. The feature had been limited beta. The feature had been in limited beta since October of last year, but the January release made it broadly available. Then on February 5th, alongside the Opus 4.6 6 launch, two things happened at once. Claude and Excel upgraded to 4.6, the same model that powered all of those amazing coding results. And Claude and PowerPoint
[03:03]
launched for the first time. The Excel integration is not a chatbot bolted onto the sidebar, even though it looks like it. It actually operates directly against your work. It reads your existing data. It understands your tab structures. It writes and debugs formulas. It builds pivot tables. Yes, it's absolutely not perfect. Yes, it needs work sometimes and a check from an experienced analyst, but I'm going to keep reminding you this is the dumbest that model is ever going to get in Excel. The PowerPoint integration is more interesting than most coverage
[03:34]
suggests. It doesn't just generate slides. It reads your slide masters, your layouts, your fonts, your color schemes, your template, your colors, your template, your font hierarchy. It produces slides that don't look like AI made them because they match the design system your team already uses. And that has been a huge breakthrough for AI in the past month or two that most people have slept on. Back in the fall of 2025, building an AI PowerPoint meant you had to give up your own templates. Not anymore. The combination of Excel and
[04:05]
PowerPoint together matters more than any of these tools by themselves. Because both run on the same underlying model, Claude is able to bring the same intelligence to bear across both. and claude produced Excel documents play very nicely with claude produced PowerPoints. So if you're building an analysis in Excel and then you tell Claude in PowerPoint to generate the board deck off of that analysis, it's going to be very easy to get from data to decision in a single sitting. That's the promise of working with Claude
[04:36]
seamlessly across a bunch of different Microsoft artifacts. So how do you get it? This is the part most of the coverage skips. So let me be specific. Claude and Excel is available now to everybody on Claude's pro plan at 20 bucks a month. That's it. Very simple. Same price as Netflix. Just install the Claude desktop app, enable the Excel integration, and it appears inside Excel. Claude in PowerPoint is harder to get right now. It launched on February 5th and is currently only available on Max Plan, which is like a hundred bucks a month. I think it's because you burn
[05:06]
more tokens on PowerPoint than Excel. It's not yet out on Pro. And if you need both tools and you're an individual, the max plan is the only option you've got. The pricing matters because of what it implies about the cost of intelligence. Junior financial analysts can cost, I don't know, six figures, $100,000, $120,000 fully loaded. An associate at a consulting firm can build 300 to 500 an hour. At that price, between 20 and 100 bucks a month for Claude and Excel and PowerPoint, there are a lot of organizations that are going to start
[05:36]
asking themselves if junior analysts are adding incremental value. I'm not saying the junior analyst role is obsolete. I'm saying the junior analyst who only builds models and decks manually has a big big problem because that scarce skill is no longer scarce and you're going to start to get measured by how quickly you can ramp on AI tooling and expand your spam. Here's where it gets really interesting because most people comparing Claude and Excel to Microsoft Copilot miss the point entirely. They're stuck in formulas. They're stuck talking about Microsoft native integrations,
[06:06]
etc. Pay attention. Anthropic partnered with Moody's, the London Stock Exchange Group, Thirdbridge, and others to build financial data connectors directly into the Claude ecosystem. These are not generic web scrapers. their authenticated structured data feeds from platforms that institutional finance runs on. Which means in practice, you can ask Claude to build a comparable company analysis and instead of manually pulling data from a terminal, the model will query live financial data through those connectors and populate your
[06:36]
spreadsheet with real numbers. Anthropic also ship pre-built financial skills, purpose-built workflows for the tasks that eat most of the analysts week, comparable company analysis, discounted cash flow models, due diligence, data packs, etc. These aren't templates that you fill in. They're intelligent workflows that understand what a discounted cash flow model actually needs and how to structure the assumptions tab to support them. For anyone who has built a discounted cash flow model from scratch, you know that the mechanical work involved takes a long time. Not because it's conceptually
[07:08]
difficult, but because there are hundreds of cells that all need to reference each other correctly. Enthropic spied that pile of mechanical work and realized with the right data feeds and the intelligence of Claude, they could knock that out and it would just make the spreadsheet dumb plumbing. And the intelligence is what would matter. I do need to address the is this real or is it a demo question heads on because I get so many questions in the comments after videos like this. Nate, this is hype. Nate, you're overhyping things again. I think the answer really matters here. Enthropic announced a
[07:39]
Goldman Sachs partnership on February 6th, and that has already been ongoing for months and months and months, while Goldman essentially pioneered this behind the scenes. Goldman is deploying Claude across accounting and compliance workflows now as a production tool. When the most prestigious investment bank in the world puts this in production for internal ops, I think you know the demo question got answered. AIG reported that Claude made their document reviews five times faster with accuracy improving from 75% to over 90%. Not faster at the
[08:12]
expense of quality. Faster and more accurate at the same time. The error rate went down while the speed went up. That was impossible in the 2010s era of software and earlier. That is a signature of a tool that does not get tired, that does not skip the boring rows, that does not assume the numbers in the summary tab match without checking. Meanwhile, the banks that manages Norway's $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund reported an estimated $213,000 hours saved from Claude and Excel. This
[08:42]
is what it looks like when you target a painoint that is scaled across a 1 and a half billion user base in Microsoft. And this is why Microsoft should be worried because Claude's entire strategy disintermediates Microsoft's influence on their own user base in their own tool. Let me walk through a few specific workflows because not everybody's a financial analyst and I want to give you a sense of what general intelligence in your tools actually looks like. Let's start with an operating model. Let's say you open a blank workbook and you have a
[09:12]
dream of a small business and you tell Claude, "Please build me a three-year operating model for my small business. This is my revenue target. This is my dream of how many people I want to hire. This is how many customers I want to get. This is the kind of product I have and what I want to sell it for. I don't know how to build a business operating plan. I need your help. It turns out Claude does a really, really good job at that. It may not be perfect, but it gets you about 90 95% of the way there out of the gate. How about a board deck? Let's
[09:42]
say you've built the model and you want Claude to build a PowerPoint you can show your banker to get a small business loan to get started. Claude can read the Excel file you upload. It can understand it because again, it's the same intelligence underneath both. It can generate the charts that reference actual numbers. It can apply your company's slide template and put out something that you can go to a banker with or you can go to an investor with. Let's say you're a startup founder and you're pitching a series B. You have your financials in Excel and a pitch template your designer built last quarter. All you have to do is tell
[10:12]
Claude, "Hey, build a 12 slide pitch deck from these financials. Here's where we want to go. Here's the arc of the story." Claude will just do it. It will use your fonts, your colors, your layout grid. And by the way, that is all new since last fall. The last time I talked about Excel, I had to be like, "It's amazing. It does PowerPoint, but one, it's not in PowerPoint, and two, good luck using your own templates and layouts." Not anymore. Not anymore. That's how fast things move. What about due diligence? Let's say you're trying to understand a small business you want
[10:42]
to buy. So, you upload 3 years of financial statements, and you tell Claude, "Please build me a due diligence data pack and flag anything unusual." Claude saves you dozens of hours combing through those financial statements and greatly increases the probability you're going to see something that might be a red flag that might stop that acquisition and save you a business deal. Let's say you're a product manager and you want to do comparable company or comparable product analysis. You name a few companies that are competitors and Claude can pull all of the relevant trading data, but also the product data
[11:12]
and actually build you a competitor spreadsheet analysis from scratch in just a few minutes. What about a quarterly business review? Your department heads submit their numbers in separate spreadsheets. You consolidate it all in Excel. You can tell Claude and PowerPoint, "Please build me the QBR deck with 15 slides using our corporate template using these numbers." Done. Now, all of these are finance workflows, but there are non- finance workflows that are just as important. I want to call out. What about a strategy analysis? You have a spreadsheet of 50
[11:43]
competitors with market positioning and recent funding routes. You want to understand how to score each competitor on six different dimensions and weight by strategic priorities. You just give it to Claude in Excel and it can do it. You give it to Claude in PowerPoint after that and it can build a competitive landscape deck with a positioning matrix, a threat assessment by segment, recommended strategic responses. What about sales enablement? Your sales team sends the same 10 slide pitch to every prospect. Why not handclaw the company's CRM data and their last three earnings transcripts
[12:13]
and tell it to customize the pitch for a CFO audience at a mid-market manufacturing company? That is trivial to do. Now, what about HR and people analytics? You export 12 months of employee survey data, 2,000 responses, free form text, like art scales, eight departments. You tell cloud in Excel, hey, analyze the sentiment by department, identify the three strongest predictors of attrition risk, and build a summary dashboard. It'll do it. What about program management? You have a master tracker in Excel with 200 line items across a dozen work streams.
[12:44]
Owners, deadline, status, dependencies. Claude can oneshot a program status deck for the steering committee. What about the formula and data work that nobody likes to talk about before you even get to the headline workflows? There's just the daily grind that cla and Excel can eliminate. Debugging a VLOOKUP chain that breaks when someone sorts a column. Writing a Power Query transformation to clean vendor data. building conditional formatting rules, tracing a circular reference across four tabs. This is the kind of work that eats hours a day when
[13:14]
you live in spreadsheets. And it's just and it's the first thing Claude handles and the thing that frees up the most time before you even start the big workflows. Every one of these workflows exists today, not next quarter, not as a wait list, right now. And here's what none of the individual workflows make obvious enough. The time savings alone aren't the thing that adds up. The time savings don't just add up, they multiply. Having Claude in Excel saves you time on modeling. Having Claude in
[13:44]
PowerPoint saves you time on deck. Having both can save you twice the time because it eliminates an entire category of work that existed solely because the tools could not understand what each other built in the age before shared intelligence. Think about what actually eats your week. It's not just building the model. It's not just building the deck. It's the mental work that comes from the translation layer in between. You finish the analysis in Excel. Then you open PowerPoint. You have to start thinking and reexplaining the same data.
[14:15]
You have to start trying to think about how it changes when you position it in a deck form versus a spreadsheet form. That translation cost is where most knowledge workers spend the majority of our production hours. It's not necessarily even thinking, right? It's translating into a different format for a different audience. When one intelligence spans both tools, that translation cost starts to drop towards zero. Claude doesn't just export the data from Excel and import it to PowerPoint. It deeply understands the data in Excel because the same
[14:46]
intelligence built it and it carries that understanding without you having to mess with it directly into the presentation. The chart it builds in PowerPoint reflects an understanding of what the model extracted from the analysis. The narrative on the slide reflects a deeper interpretation that the model formed when building the Excel spreadsheet. Context flows more easily because the same model is building both. Now, I'm not saying that there's a direct export to PowerPoint from Excel today, but I would bet you a lunch that
[15:18]
is coming in the next couple months. And in the meantime, having that ability to have a model understand how both Excel and PowerPoint works and easily translate context between them is a godsend. What we're talking about here is the context layer that is the future of work and it's going to be enormous. It's not really about the application layer anymore. Microsoft owns that. It's not even necessarily about the data layer. Your databases own that. The context layer sits between them. It's the AI's accumulated understanding of
[15:49]
your data, your brand, your audience, your goals. Every time the model touches a new tool, the context layer is going to get a little bit richer. Every time it sees how your board deck differs from your team Slack update, it's going to learn something about how your org translates information for different audiences. Applications are containers. The data is raw material. The context layer is what Anthropic is making a play for here. It's the intelligence that understands what the data means and how to express it for different audiences in different formats. That is where the
[16:20]
value is accumulating and that is what Enthropic is laser focused on with claude in Excel and Claude in PowerPoint. And unlike the application layer which Microsoft has owned for decades and which barely changes year after year, no matter what they say, the context layer improves automatically with every single model upgrade and every new tool integration. It's the fastest compounding asset in your tech stack and most organizations don't even know it exists. And that's what separates what happened this week from a normal product launch because on Tuesday
[16:51]
night, the night before Opus 4.6 launch, Claude and Excel ran on Opus 4.5, a strong model, capable, useful, and on Wednesday morning, it ran on Opus 4.6. Nobody installed anything. Nobody downloaded a patch. Nobody sat through a migration wizard. The spreadsheet looked the same, but it suddenly had x more context and dramatically better reasoning and the ability to hold an entire multi-tab model in working memory and understand how every cell relates to every other cell. Think about what that
[17:21]
means for the next upgrade. Opus 4.7 is coming. So is 5.0. Each time a new model ships, every claw powered Excel and PowerPoint on Earth gets smarter overnight without you doing anything. The operating model that took 10 minutes with Opus 4.6 six might take five with 4.7 and be 99% right, not 95. The pitch deck that needed 20 minutes of back and forth with 4.6 might need 5 minutes with 5.0. The quality of reasoning continues to improve. The depth of analysis
[17:52]
deepens. The output moves closer to perfect. And it's not because you learned a new tool. It's because the tool learned on its own and got better. This is a fundamentally different upgrade cycle from anything the software industry has produced. Microsoft ships a new version of Office every few years. Feature updates land quarterly. The pace of improvement is set by the software company's release schedule, its engineering priorities, its QA cycle. The pace of improvement is actually set by Anthropic's insanely fast pace of model releases. And those are happening
[18:23]
every couple of months with capability jumps that would be measured in years by traditional software standards. That 3mon gap between 4.5 and 4.6 context expansion. 5xed in just 3 months. What's 4.7 going to bring? Almost certainly your mental model of what AI tools can do is now behind reality. It is hard to keep up with how fast reality is moving right now. The task that Claude maybe couldn't handle last month in Excel, maybe it handles it now. The presentation quality that
[18:54]
wasn't sufficient in January because it didn't match your templates, maybe it works now. And by April, both will have improved again. The assumption is that you learn your tools once and they stay the same. That the thing you tested last quarter is the same thing that's running today. That assumption is dead. Your tools are getting smarter faster than you're updating your expectations of them. And the practical consequence is that you're going to need to re-evaluate your workflows continuously. Not annually, not when someone sends you a blog post all the time. because the
[19:25]
boundary between the tasks I do myself and the tasks that it is smart to delegate to AI just keeps moving and it's moving in one direction and it's moving real fast. I can hear the Microsofties in the comments saying, "Doesn't Microsoft Copilot already do this?" Well, the answer is sort of and the real answer leads somewhere more important than a feature comparison. Pilot's advantage of course is a native integration. It's built into Microsoft 365 from the ground up. The UI is seamless. It understands the Office
[19:55]
ecosystem in a way a third party tool doesn't. If your org lives within Microsoft, C-pilot is the path of least resistance and sometimes it's sold that way. Claude's advantages of course are reasoning depth, local file support, financial data connectors. Claude wins on the tasks that require genuine reasoning over complex multi-step problems like debugging a formula chain across 12 tabs or structuring an analysis that requires judgment about what matters. And the local file setup matters a lot as well. C-pilot will require one drive for most of its
[20:25]
functionality, which means your files live in the Microsoft cloud. Of course, it's a Microsoft play. For orgs handling sensitive financial data, it's kind of nice to not have to do that with claude. But in the end, the co-pilot comparison is the wrong frame for what's actually going on. I think the real story is more structural than that. In September of 2025, Microsoft added Claude models to its co-pilot. Yes, that's right. There's Claude in co-pilot, too. So Microsoft, the company that invested $13 billion in OpenAI, built C-pilot on OpenAI's models
[20:56]
originally, now hedged by putting a competitor's brain, quote unquote, inside its own product. When the company that owns the application layer starts offering someone else's intelligence inside it, it tells you where the value is migrating. Microsoft really is becoming a dumb pipe. It's not overnight. It's not completely, but the pattern is unmistakable and it mirrors what is happening to every platform that is getting caught between a commoditizing interface and a rapidly improving capability layer. AT&amp;T built
[21:26]
the network. Then the network became a pipe for Google and Netflix. The value migrated from the carrier to the service. Browsers were supposed to be the platform and then they became rendering engines for web applications. Value migrated from the container to what ran inside it. Excel is a grid of cells. has been essentially the same for 20 years. New features are at the margins. It's the same fundamental tool. PowerPoint is just a canvas for slides. Same story. The intelligence layer is what is compounding. The application layer is frozen. And that is why
[21:56]
Microsoft is hedging by offering every major AI model inside its own products. That's exactly what a dump pipe does. It carries whatever traffic flows through it. The implication for your organization is to stop thinking about your tool choice quite as much and start thinking about your intelligence choice. The question is not should we use Excel or Google Sheets. It's which AI model powers our spreadsheet and is it the best one for the work that we do and our workflows. You need to start thinking of applications as containers and asking
[22:26]
about where the intelligence is coming from and whether the intelligence has the value you're looking for. This is the thing that we aren't talking about enough. If the cost of producing these artifacts is collapsing towards zero extremely rapidly, what happens when these artifacts are free? So much of our traditional human-drived software model starts to break apart. Consulting breaks. Not because consultants are unnecessary, but because the business model depends on a very large time component that is about to disappear.
[22:57]
When a deliverable that build at 40 hours of associate time could be produced in 40 minutes, that whole model isn't going to work anymore. The correct response here is not panic. It's recognizing what becomes valuable when artifacts go to zero. Analysis is becoming a commodity. Judgment is becoming very, very valuable. Knowing how to build a discounted cash flow sheet, well, Claude can do that. knowing which assumptions you want to stress test, which scenarios to run, what stories the numbers are telling, and how to read the clawed spreadsheet and find
[23:29]
the mistakes. There's judgment there, and judgment is what clients are going to pay for and boards are going to need. The people who thrive in this environment are not the ones who will build the best artifacts with AI. They're the ones who know which questions to ask before whatever the model is building gets gets built. They're the ones who can look at a completed analysis and say, you know, this is technically right, but the whole question is wrong. It's framed wrong. That's value. That's where human value
[23:59]
is going. They're the ones who understand the business well enough to know which of the 17 possible analyses Claude produced is the one that should actually drive the decision. This is the strategic skill I keep coming back to. When production is free, economic returns flow to people who know what's worth making. Not necessarily more of, not necessarily better of, not even faster, because the 10-minute operating model is worthless if you're modeling the wrong thing. The 30 minute board deck I talked about is worthless if it
[24:29]
tells a story that doesn't match reality and doesn't line up with investor expectations. Sometimes reality and investor expectations don't line up, but that's a different story. The tool will make you faster. Only you can make sure it's right. And there's an uncomfortable truth here that is hiding inside all of this. capability and that is a tidal wave of slop. Every tool that makes it easy to produce excellent work makes it super easy to produce garbage and we are about to drown in AI generated garbage
[24:59]
that looks professional. Researchers have started calling it work slop and it's true. It's AI generated professional content that looks technically competent and is completely hollow. The estimated productivity cost, by the way, $186 per employee per month in time wasted processing work. That sounds like it means something and says nothing. That adds up and I bet it's underelling. This isn't really about an AI adoption problem. It's not about whether you rethink your workflow or just bolt AI onto the old workflow. This
[25:31]
is a fundamentally different problem. This is about whether you have the judgment to know which work should exist and whether you work on a team that displays that judgment as well. The same capability that lets a thoughtful strategist produce a day's work in 10 minutes lets a careless operator produce a week's worth of polished nothing in an afternoon. The tool will never know the difference because you are the one that maps what is needed onto the business context and what the market requires.
[26:02]
And that's on you. In this sense, taste, which gets talked about a lot, it's not an aesthetic preference. It's not something that is impossible to learn. It's just the ability to distinguish between output that serves a really interesting human purpose that matters and output that just exists. It's knowing that a 40 slide deck that Opus can create may look impressive, but it's not as valuable as the 10 slide deck. It's knowing the third scenario in the model is what the board needs to see, not the other two. It's knowing when the analysis is done,
[26:33]
you shouldn't add more data because that's just going to dilute things. Organizations that have people with good judgment are about to massively outexecute the same organizations with the same tools in the same industry that don't have people with good judgment. Good judgment is about to supercharge economic activity for organizations that understand how to deploy it. I want to leave you with the implication that I think matters the most. For 30 years or more, professional value has been built on execution skills. Can you build the model? Can you write the code? Can you
[27:04]
design the spreadsheet? Can you structure the analysis? Those execution skills created our whole modern knowledge economy. They're what universities teach. They're what hiring managers were taught to screen for. That execution premium is just evaporating now. Not in five years. Now, the 10-minute operating model isn't a preview of a future. It's a product you could buy today. But what is not evaporating is the thinking that sits above the execution layer. We have to move up a level of abstraction in our
[27:35]
work as knowledge workers all of us. Now it's the ability to frame the right question. It's the strategic awareness to know which analysis matters because the tools are going to keep getting better. The thinking is the place that has to have the value. Claude can build the vehicle for your thinking, but Claude cannot replace human judgment. And in that sense, I think Anthropic has done a great job calling out Claude as a tool for human thinking, similar to a chalkboard or a notebook. That's the right frame. And I think that's a very
[28:06]
compelling frame for professionals who are looking to elevate our art in the age of AI. We got to do better because the AI is coming for the traditional execution skills that define knowledge management. And so my challenge to you, if you haven't tried Claude in Excel, if you haven't tried Claude in PowerPoint, give it a try. But more importantly, and yes, I have tons of guides on that in Substack, I wrote up a whole guide just for that for today. It's going to be great, but I don't care about that. The
[28:36]
point is that you need to try it and you need to understand that it is your ability to frame problems. It is your ability to decide what is good that is going to distinguish your value long term. All of that stuff that you were proud of around execution that's going to go the way of the dodo. The models are going to keep getting better. What was 95% good will be solved by the middle of the year. It's your ability to say this is the right direction to go in that is going to make or break your career in 2026 and 2027. Good luck and
[29:07]
have fun in Excel. It's a lot less painful now than it was 10 years ago. And yes, it really is true. PowerPoint can now work with your company's templates. One of the biggest wins of 2026, I think. All right. Have fun, guys.
