[00:00] I'll let you in to a little secret.
[00:02] There's a tool called Weev AAI that is
[00:05] the secret to creating absolutely
[00:08] jaw-dropping beautiful mobile apps,
[00:11] software, etc. So, if you're anything
[00:14] like me, you vibe coded using tools like
[00:17] Google AI Studio, Claude Code, Lovable,
[00:21] and the results don't look that
[00:23] beautiful. Like, they they look fine,
[00:25] but they don't look beautiful. And why
[00:27] beautiful matters is you want people to
[00:29] fall in love with your product. So, how
[00:32] do you actually do that? Well, I brought
[00:34] on my friend Sarah, who's an incredible
[00:37] designer. She sold her last company to
[00:40] Snap, and she walks us through her
[00:42] entire AI workflow, including how to use
[00:46] Weebi AI, the secret tool that is so,
[00:49] so, so powerful that could help you
[00:52] create beautiful jawdropping designs. In
[00:56] this episode, we do a live build. We
[00:58] actually show you how we can live build
[01:01] using Google AI Studio, using Claude,
[01:04] using Weevai, using Figma, and going
[01:07] back to Google AI Studio. So, this is
[01:09] the entire workflow. People who stick
[01:11] around to the end of this episode are
[01:13] going to be weapons. This is a tutorial
[01:16] that doesn't exist anywhere on the
[01:17] internet. So, give a like, comment, and
[01:20] subscribe for more in this in your feed.
[01:22] Let's get going.
[01:25] all this
[01:29] time, baby.
[01:32] &gt;&gt; I begged her to come on to the pod.
[01:34] Sariah, a dear friend of mine, probably
[01:37] one of the most talented designers and
[01:39] you, 99% of people haven't heard of her.
[01:41] She sold her last company to Snap. She's
[01:44] incredible. And I asked her to come on
[01:46] for one sole reason. There's a lot of us
[01:49] who are vibe coding apps, but they look
[01:52] kind of garbage. and Sariah's AI
[01:55] workflow. She uses tools like Weevai,
[01:57] she uses Claude,
[01:59] she uses Flux, she uses a lot and she's
[02:04] able to create apps and websites and SAS
[02:06] products that really resonate with
[02:08] people. So Sariah, thank you for coming
[02:10] on and I'm hoping that you can teach us
[02:13] how to do how to how to create gorgeous
[02:16] vibecoded apps.
[02:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you for having me. Very kind
[02:21] intro. Um, yeah, I think this will be
[02:23] fun.
[02:24] &gt;&gt; Okay, so if people stick around to the
[02:27] end of the episode, tactically like what
[02:29] are people going to learn?
[02:30] &gt;&gt; Okay, you will learn how to design
[02:33] something that looks like an agency
[02:34] designed it.
[02:36] &gt;&gt; Okay. And not just not just any agency.
[02:39] &gt;&gt; No, no, like a real brand designer. And
[02:42] maybe more importantly, you'll learn how
[02:44] to make something that someone actually
[02:45] wants to download. Um, and you can use
[02:50] yourself as an example. you'll see an ad
[02:51] for it yourself and be like, "Oh, I
[02:53] would actually use that."
[02:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And to be honest, like, as much as
[02:57] I wanted to do this for the pod, I
[02:59] wanted to do this for myself. Um,
[03:01] because I wanted to learn, I think
[03:02] there's so much opportunity right now to
[03:05] be vibe coding products that people love
[03:07] using, you know, IG reels and Tik Tok
[03:11] ads to to get it to market. But, you
[03:13] know, a lot of times when I'm vibe
[03:14] coding stuff, it just looks kind of kind
[03:17] of lame. So, what you're showing me
[03:19] today, before we get into it, what
[03:21] you're showing me today, I'll be able to
[03:23] to to basically design products this
[03:27] this beautiful.
[03:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[03:30] &gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Well, show us how.
[03:32] &gt;&gt; Okay, amazing. Um, okay. Yeah, by the
[03:36] end of this episode, we should have
[03:38] something like this designed and walk
[03:40] through how we do it. So, let's get
[03:42] started. Um, we already introed this,
[03:44] but we should build something that
[03:46] doesn't look like a robot made it. Um,
[03:50] anyone can build an app now. It's
[03:52] amazing. So much has changed, but now
[03:54] everything looks the same. And so, if
[03:57] you're going to make something that
[03:58] looks like everything else, it's just
[04:00] really tough to actually expect anyone
[04:02] to download it. Um, I am obsessed with
[04:05] branding. I love branding. We should
[04:07] think of it as the same thing as the
[04:10] product, same thing as engineering, like
[04:12] everything is branding. But to actually
[04:14] prove why um okay, let's make an app. We
[04:18] thought we would use a voice journal app
[04:20] as an example. I feel like it's a right
[04:24] of passage to want to make a journaling
[04:26] app.
[04:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[04:29] &gt;&gt; I'm always like, I should journal. And
[04:31] then I'm like, why don't I just make a
[04:32] journaling app instead? Um, okay. So,
[04:35] for this demo, we're going to use Google
[04:38] AI Studio. It's definitely one of my
[04:40] favorite vibe coding apps. It's really
[04:43] good at oneshotting interfaces, but
[04:46] we're more so focusing on design here.
[04:48] But, let's just use this kind of basic
[04:49] prompt like build a mobileiz voice
[04:51] journaling app. Users can see a home
[04:54] screen, record voice entries, see the
[04:55] transcript, browse past entries,
[04:59] and have it build it. Let's see how long
[05:02] this takes.
[05:03] It's pretty quick. I would say like two
[05:06] minutes or under.
[05:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's honestly so quick. It's
[05:09] amazing. It's kind of become my favorite
[05:11] oneshot
[05:13] um tool for vibe coding.
[05:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm s I like Have you used any
[05:18] other tools? Like why you why suggest
[05:20] Google AI Studio?
[05:22] &gt;&gt; I use AI So AI Studio is my favorite for
[05:24] like a oneshot prototype. So if you just
[05:26] want to see something, you're not
[05:28] working in an existing codebase, you're
[05:31] just like, what would this look like?
[05:32] Google AI Studio is really good because
[05:34] it'll do it end to end. When I'm
[05:36] actually working day-to-day in an
[05:37] existing codebase, um like in my current
[05:39] startup, we typically focus on using
[05:42] cloud code just because it's really good
[05:44] at working within a codebase. Um, and
[05:47] then sometimes if I do want the
[05:49] capabilities of Gemini, but I still want
[05:52] to work in um an existing codebase, I'll
[05:55] use Gemini's model and cursor. And then
[05:58] I found that Gemini is really good at UI
[06:00] and shader work and like more complex
[06:02] animations,
[06:04] &gt;&gt; which is key, right? Cuz we're going to
[06:06] take this one shot and then we're just
[06:08] going to trying to paint it beautifully,
[06:11] right?
[06:12] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. we're going to take
[06:13] this one shot and be like, "Okay, we
[06:15] have the functionality. Now, how do we
[06:17] make it something that a human would
[06:20] actually use?"
[06:21] &gt;&gt; And I think the problem is what a lot of
[06:23] people do is they go back and forth
[06:26] uh you know, pingpong so to speak with
[06:29] the AI models when they need to kind of
[06:31] take a step back and then figure out the
[06:33] branding and then apply that branding to
[06:36] the app. Right.
[06:37] &gt;&gt; 100%. Like you can think of it as like
[06:39] what do you want to outsource and what
[06:41] do you not want to outsource. Like you
[06:44] could say this focuses on like what it
[06:46] should do but you want to keep as much
[06:49] like how it should do it to your own
[06:51] brain so that it like actually feels
[06:53] distinct and looks different. Otherwise
[06:55] like it makes sense that everything
[06:57] would look the same if you're
[06:58] outsourcing like all of the thinking. Um
[07:01] but what's amazing is we can now
[07:02] outsource stuff that are solved
[07:05] problems. like it's a solved problem to
[07:07] build a lot of this, but your unique
[07:10] take is pretty important.
[07:12] &gt;&gt; And I'm I'm actually really interested
[07:13] to see how you use Weebi AI to do it. I
[07:16] know we're going to get there, but
[07:18] that's a tool that I've been meaning to
[07:20] try for a very long time. I just it's a
[07:23] bit o it feels like a bit overwhelming
[07:24] to be honest. Uh
[07:26] &gt;&gt; I think actually even as a designer like
[07:29] I used to not like nodebased tools even
[07:31] though like origami and stuff was really
[07:33] popular, I never personally liked it.
[07:35] Um, but I think with like AI models are
[07:38] the unlock for it for making them like
[07:40] actually super useful. Okay, let's see
[07:42] what this generated. Okay, this
[07:44] generated. Good morning. You can record.
[07:47] Hello. Hello. Hello. It's going to
[07:49] record something.
[07:51] Stop recording it. Pretty cool. I mean,
[07:53] it's still obviously really epic to see
[07:55] that this could get generated in like 20
[07:57] seconds or 2 minutes or however long it
[07:58] took. Okay, cool. You can see the home
[08:01] and you can see the journal. Let's take
[08:03] screenshots of this and see what it
[08:06] looks like in our Figma. So, this is the
[08:09] app that got generated via Google. And I
[08:12] mean, honestly, like if the app store
[08:14] was just invented, it wouldn't be that
[08:16] bad cuz it was a novel thing to be able
[08:19] to record back then, but now that we're
[08:22] so used to software, like if we were to
[08:25] see this on Instagram or Tik Tok, um we
[08:28] would not download it ourselves to use.
[08:30] It's true, you know, and I don't think a
[08:32] lot of people are saying that, right?
[08:34] So, yeah. So, how do we how do we this
[08:36] is really cool and it's got a good
[08:38] foundation. How do we take this
[08:40] foundation and build something
[08:41] beautiful?
[08:42] &gt;&gt; Okay, so the helpful part about this is
[08:44] we know what it needs to do. So, let's
[08:45] just like quickly write down what it
[08:46] needs to it needs to record
[08:49] record audio. It needs to Let's see what
[08:53] else. It needs to have a history.
[08:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. what you record and it needs to
[08:58] have like a button to actually start
[09:01] recording or let's we already have that
[09:04] with record audio. It needs to have
[09:06] timer while you're recording.
[09:08] &gt;&gt; So basically you just you just outline
[09:11] what the screens need to do at this
[09:13] stage.
[09:14] &gt;&gt; And most people stop here, right? Like
[09:15] vibe coding focuses a lot on like what
[09:18] does the thing do? It records, it shows
[09:20] your history, and there's a timer. Um
[09:22] but that's like not what a product is.
[09:25] is like you don't really think of your
[09:27] favorite products in the world and
[09:28] think, "Oh, it does this." You think,
[09:30] "Oh, it makes my life easier and I just
[09:32] feel so good using it and like blah blah
[09:34] blah blah blah." So that's what we're
[09:35] going to focus on now. An equally
[09:37] important thing to what it does is like
[09:39] how should it do it? So I literally
[09:42] always start here. Like I define how
[09:44] something should make you feel. And even
[09:46] though that sounds like a little
[09:47] designer hippie-dippy, it's like really
[09:49] not. Um, and so, okay, I kind of wrote
[09:53] out this prompt beforehand. Um, and this
[09:56] is exactly something that I would paste
[09:58] in Claude, and we're going to paste it
[09:59] in Claude and see what it thinks. But
[10:01] let's just talk about how the audio
[10:04] journal app should make someone feel.
[10:07] I think it should make someone feel, or
[10:11] let me rephrase, um, who are we making
[10:14] this for? We're making an audio journal
[10:16] app for someone who wants to get their
[10:19] thoughts out. It's too long to write
[10:21] them out on pen and paper, but there
[10:24] might there may be tired of just like
[10:26] using tech all the time and like being
[10:28] on their phone all the time. And so that
[10:30] tells us that we don't want people to
[10:31] feel like they're just in any other app.
[10:33] So that means that our original design
[10:35] already failed because this like 100%
[10:37] feels like every other app on the
[10:39] planet. And so it kind of goes against
[10:41] like why someone would download an AI
[10:43] journal in the first place, which is
[10:44] like to feel calmer and just get your
[10:47] thoughts out. So now we know, okay, we
[10:50] want someone to feel maybe like they're
[10:53] in something analog. We want to be able
[10:55] to think out loud, but not feel like
[10:57] they're on their phones. Um, and they
[11:00] shouldn't feel like we're trying to
[11:01] steal their attention and like force a
[11:04] bunch of ads and random stuff down their
[11:05] throat, like a lot of apps. Let's go
[11:08] ahead and paste this into Claude so that
[11:11] it can help us along the way. I'm
[11:14] designing a voice journaling app. Let's
[11:16] have it help us define how it feels,
[11:20] blah blah blah, and see what it says.
[11:24] &gt;&gt; And what's your advice for people who
[11:26] like I I feel like your insights there
[11:28] were really bang on. Like any advice for
[11:31] people to come up with insights like
[11:32] that?
[11:33] &gt;&gt; Good question. Um, I think an example is
[11:38] I I I actually use movies and TV shows
[11:40] as a reference a lot. Like movies and TV
[11:43] shows have a beginning, middle, end. And
[11:46] if we think of a product like that, it
[11:47] becomes a lot easier. Like if we're
[11:49] building like a health tracking app, we
[11:52] don't really care about the middle and
[11:54] end yet. We care about the beginning and
[11:56] that's like how someone feels. So we
[11:58] might say like, okay, we want someone to
[11:59] feel
[12:01] not anxious by like having some annoying
[12:04] coach telling them what to do every 5
[12:06] seconds. Like that might not get the
[12:08] girl who I want to download it to
[12:10] download it.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; And so if you just think really like as
[12:12] a human, I think that's why people say
[12:14] like build stuff for yourself cuz it's
[12:16] like you naturally know how you feel and
[12:18] how you want to feel. Um, I don't think
[12:20] you have to build for yourself. Like I
[12:23] But you also have to think about like,
[12:24] okay, then how would that person want to
[12:26] feel? And then you work backward
[12:28] backwards like, okay, I want this girl
[12:31] to feel
[12:33] calm. Therefore, it probably can't have
[12:36] like 75 timers saying like track these
[12:38] 5,000 things and like work backwards of
[12:42] those like key words. But also like
[12:43] Claude helps with it a lot. So, even if
[12:45] we said something like, "I'm designing a
[12:47] voice journal app.
[12:49] I want people to feel calm or they're
[12:52] tired of their phones." Like, you could
[12:54] kind of see, okay, what does it say? How
[12:56] should it feel? Like, do I actually like
[12:57] what it's saying or do I not? And like
[12:59] you keep I I think Claude is like the
[13:01] perfect brainstorming tool.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; Cool. That's helpful.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; So, here, let's see what it says. It
[13:06] says this is for the overinker that
[13:08] needs to exhale. Mind's constantly
[13:11] running. Sure. Whatever. Over
[13:13] stimulated. Yep. Like this all sounds
[13:15] like pretty spot-on. They crave
[13:18] permission to be unpolished. They
[13:20] suspicious of apps that um want too much
[13:24] of them. Analog warmth. That's cool
[13:27] because it's highly visual. So I think
[13:29] like the things to take from this are
[13:30] like what are things that are like very
[13:32] visual. And then also what's equally
[13:34] helpful is like what is it not? It's not
[13:36] productivity tool. That's important
[13:38] because that's really the opposite of
[13:39] like a private space to rant. It's not
[13:42] social. um not needy. Okay, this is
[13:46] really helpful. And I don't tend to use
[13:48] the questions it asks for this branding
[13:50] process cuz it's more about like what do
[13:52] we want from this? And then let's go
[13:55] back to the Figma.
[13:57] So now Claude knows enough to kind of
[13:59] help us create brand guidelines. I feel
[14:01] like a lot of people think of brand
[14:02] guidelines as this like corporate like
[14:05] afterpaint structure, but it's really
[14:07] not. Brand guidelines are really just
[14:09] like um a prompt in it of itself and
[14:13] it's a prompt we're going to bring into
[14:14] Weevi. So let's call our app cassette.
[14:18] So we can say let's call our app
[14:21] cassette.
[14:24] Based on that, write me brand
[14:26] guidelines.
[14:29] And we'll just kind of use this
[14:30] throughout.
[14:33] I'm happy you said, by the way, that you
[14:35] think brand guidelines sounds corporaty
[14:37] cuz
[14:40] I sort of know that people are thinking
[14:44] that in their heads.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; Like a different phrase. Oh gosh, it's
[14:49] going really extra. It's making like
[14:51] literal brand guidelines. No, no, no.
[14:54] Just write them out, please.
[14:57] What people don't realize is the brand
[14:59] guidelines is what's going to get people
[15:00] to download your app.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; It's the opposite of corporate jargon
[15:04] and corporate stuff, right?
[15:06] &gt;&gt; 100%. Like if a brand is successful, you
[15:08] won't notice it in the final app. It'll
[15:11] just feel good.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; And that's really the goal of like all
[15:13] these complexities and processes. Like
[15:16] you don't do processes. Like sometimes
[15:18] you could literally just sketch
[15:19] something and that's it and you've got
[15:20] it. It's just about knowing like what
[15:23] you want. But I think these tools are
[15:25] nice because they help you get to know
[15:26] what you want. Like we can look at this
[15:28] and see, do we like it or not? Like
[15:30] cassette. Deliberate misspelling of
[15:32] cassette. That was not deliberate. That
[15:33] was my bad. That's really not important.
[15:36] Cassette is a voice journal for people
[15:38] who think out loud but are tired of
[15:39] being on their phones. Totally spot on.
[15:42] Let's put that in the Figma. We like
[15:44] that. That seems like a good thing to
[15:46] put into Weevie. And that's kind of just
[15:48] what you do. Like you just take stuff
[15:50] from here that you like. Um, and like
[15:55] let's see where it talks about
[15:58] cassette is the satisfying click of a
[16:00] record button. That feels really nice
[16:03] because we can kind of feel that like,
[16:06] okay, maybe we just build our whole
[16:07] visual style around like analog cassette
[16:12] um, designs. And so I usually will just
[16:16] like talk back and forth with Claude.
[16:18] Um, it could take one chat like this or
[16:21] a few more until you kind of end up with
[16:23] guidelines that you like. So, I think
[16:25] parts of this are relevant and then a
[16:27] bunch of it we don't really need. But
[16:29] for now, let's just take like these two
[16:32] things. Voice journal, people who think
[16:34] out loud. It's focused on analog and
[16:37] like a record button. And then the next
[16:40] tool I use is Cosmos. Cosmos is my it's
[16:44] honestly one of my favorite apps just in
[16:46] general. Um, it's an alternative to
[16:50] Pinterest and it's beautiful and it's
[16:53] usually where I make mood boards. So, I
[16:56] prepared a mood board for this voice
[16:58] app, but I'm going to show you just like
[17:01] very easily how
[17:04] um you could add to it or do the same.
[17:06] It's super simple. Like you could
[17:08] literally just type vintage cassette.
[17:10] Oh, there's this like cassette and you
[17:13] can kind of go down all these clusters.
[17:16] Um, and Cosmos is really nice because
[17:19] you kind of just end up in this like
[17:20] endless loop. And so if you really like
[17:22] the colors in this, I'm going to add
[17:24] this to our voice app mood board. And
[17:27] then you can just keep going until you
[17:30] stop. I usually end up on this site just
[17:34] without even trying. Um, so if we go
[17:37] back to the mood board, you can kind of
[17:40] feel the vibe that like all of these are
[17:43] matching the stuff we just talked about.
[17:45] like they're all really analog. We can
[17:47] lean into the analog vibe to make
[17:49] something feel how we said in the
[17:52] beginning, which is like not very techy,
[17:55] not overwhelming, and like personal.
[17:59] And so the next step is the main part
[18:02] we're going to talk about, which is
[18:03] Weebi. So Weevie, super cool app. Um,
[18:06] like Greg mentioned earlier, it's
[18:08] nodebased
[18:10] and yeah, kind of like you said, it
[18:12] looks complex. Like if you zoom out, it
[18:15] has like this beautiful complex thing,
[18:16] but it's actually really not. I found
[18:18] that it's just the best way to try any
[18:20] model um visually and like really really
[18:24] quickly for honestly any project. Um, so
[18:29] let's get back to branding. I went ahead
[18:32] and I saved all the images from this
[18:34] mood board to my desktop. So, you just
[18:36] like go into it, click save. Um, then it
[18:39] saves and then you just paste them all
[18:43] into Weevi
[18:45] so that we can use them for branding
[18:49] and then they load really quickly.
[18:52] Um, let's put them all together.
[18:55] And now the question, this is what's not
[18:58] really, this is what you couldn't do in
[19:00] the past. Like in the past, you'd have a
[19:02] mood board and then it's like, okay,
[19:04] then what? It's all this work and you
[19:05] have to like contact a designer and have
[19:07] them like look at the mood board, create
[19:08] custom assets from it and like all this
[19:10] stuff. But now, literally anyone can do
[19:13] it. Um, let's go back to the Figma.
[19:16] Okay, so we did the mood board. Cool.
[19:19] And now we're going to start a weebi.
[19:21] And so the way you use Weevie and the
[19:23] way I use it is I kind of switch between
[19:25] Claude and Weevie and I have Claude
[19:28] create the prompts that I want to put
[19:30] into Weevie. And so okay, we're going to
[19:33] start with colors. Colors is like a mood
[19:36] board kind of the most primitive easy
[19:40] thing to start with and then it's going
[19:42] to be like building blocks like colors
[19:44] and then backgrounds and then buttons
[19:45] and images. And you could think of it as
[19:47] like a literal painting and we're kind
[19:48] of starting with the background. So, we
[19:50] have this image in Weevi, one of the
[19:52] mood board references. You're going to
[19:53] take it as an input and let's use an
[19:56] image model. We're going to use Flex 2
[19:58] Pro. It's a very good just like general
[20:00] model to use for a bunch of stuff. And
[20:02] so, then in the prompt, we can write
[20:04] something like,
[20:06] I need a color palette. Extract colors
[20:09] from this reference image.
[20:17] And let's see what it does.
[20:20] And usually when I run these models, I
[20:23] run a bunch of different ones. Like,
[20:26] let's do the same thing on this one cuz
[20:28] this is kind of nice. And let's just say
[20:31] give
[20:34] give me a color palette based on this
[20:38] image,
[20:40] but make it textured and vintage.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; And you're doing that cuz you're you
[20:46] want to see like what's going to get you
[20:47] the best result. Yes. So,
[20:50] you want to see what's going to get you
[20:52] the best result and what's going to get
[20:55] you I mean part of this is developing
[20:56] your own taste in general and in the
[20:58] product you're making. So, like if we go
[21:00] back to okay, I want this person to feel
[21:03] retro, calm, cool. Um what else? Like
[21:07] not too techy. Like what matches that?
[21:09] So that's another reason I start with
[21:11] like how do you want the end person to
[21:12] feel is like any step of the way you
[21:14] just kind of go back to that and are
[21:15] like is this true or not true? So, like
[21:18] I kind of like thought I would love this
[21:20] more, but I kind of love this more
[21:22] personally. Like it just feels really
[21:24] cohesive and there's like a really nice
[21:26] textural element to it.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; And so maybe that tells us like, oh, we
[21:30] should lean into like the textures of
[21:34] cassette tapes and
[21:37] um stuff like that. Like actually
[21:39] earlier when I kind of was thinking
[21:41] through this demo, um I did some other
[21:44] variations and kind of ended up with
[21:48] like a similar metaphor of like, okay,
[21:50] how can we lean into this like analog
[21:52] cassette tape? Um so maybe we kind of
[21:55] run with that. So now we have like a
[21:58] couple color palettes. Um
[22:01] but I don't know about you, but I
[22:02] personally also am like obsessed with
[22:04] this image, honestly. Like this could
[22:06] literally be the app.
[22:09] But and honestly sometimes I do that
[22:11] like I'll find one image I like and then
[22:14] make a whole company based off that
[22:16] image.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; Like
[22:19] my last startup I worked on literally I
[22:21] just found like one image and then the
[22:22] whole branding came from that one image.
[22:24] So I wouldn't be afraid of doing that.
[22:25] Like you could literally just love this
[22:26] image so much and be like this is the
[22:28] whole app the whole product like every
[22:30] &gt;&gt; I mean didn't Johnny I do that with Dita
[22:32] Rams and Apple like that's basically
[22:35] what he did I think you know Johnny Ives
[22:39] who used to run design at Apple was a
[22:40] huge Dita Rams fan. I think Dita Rams
[22:44] was you know creating stuff in the 50s
[22:46] and 60s and just saw some of his stuff
[22:49] and then that inspired a whole set of
[22:52] Apple products from that. So, we're not
[22:55] reinventing the wheel here. We're just
[22:57] doing it using different tools.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; 100%. It's all the same exact thing. And
[23:01] even for the new product I'm working on
[23:03] right now, like I literally just found
[23:04] one image that I really liked and now
[23:07] the entire product is based on this like
[23:09] one shadow image.
[23:10] &gt;&gt; So, this one I feel like it's kind of
[23:12] nice to find that image. So, like we
[23:14] have these two color palettes, but I
[23:15] also just personally like this image.
[23:17] And I think why do we like it? like we
[23:19] have to think about like, okay, well,
[23:20] we're using the colors that feel analog,
[23:22] but we still have like maybe a
[23:24] background that feels calm and like
[23:27] versatile. So, now we kind of know like,
[23:30] okay, we have a bunch of colors to play
[23:31] with. We're experimenting with colors
[23:33] and you can kind of go back and forth
[23:35] between like what do you need help with
[23:37] from Claude and what do you just want to
[23:38] put into Weebi. Like sometimes if
[23:40] something isn't coming out in Weebi how
[23:42] you like it, just tell Claude, say to
[23:44] Claude like, "I want a better prompt for
[23:46] getting a color palette from an image."
[23:48] Or you can just go directly into Weebi.
[23:51] Um, and so one idea that actually came
[23:54] up when I was looking at this image is
[23:56] like we really like texture, which we
[23:59] saw here. We also really like this just
[24:02] like pretty analog hybrid machine thing.
[24:07] So, what if the anchor of our visual
[24:10] system, if you will, is like as you use
[24:13] the product more, this becomes more used
[24:16] visually. Like, what do you think?
[24:19] &gt;&gt; I love that. I love that. I mean, like
[24:20] digital products, think about it.
[24:22] They're kind of like cartoons. It's like
[24:24] The Simpsons never got older, you know,
[24:26] but time went on.
[24:28] So, I like this con. That's a huge
[24:30] That's a winning concept. I'm I'm in.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; Okay. I love that. True. And I feel like
[24:34] sometimes if you overuse analog things
[24:36] digitally, but there's no purpose to
[24:38] them, it feels kind of gimmicky. And so
[24:40] you got to think about too like what's
[24:42] the purpose of your brand element? Like
[24:45] it's not for the sake of it. Like we're
[24:46] not just putting this to be pretty. But
[24:48] if you're making it more like used like
[24:52] you would in the real world, then it's
[24:54] also just like a reason for someone to
[24:55] actually use it every day. So then we
[24:58] might say to Claude, "I have a product
[25:01] idea. that the app should age with use.
[25:04] Um, new users get a nice interface, blah
[25:07] blah blah, but we want to extract that
[25:12] loved and used feeling. And then let's
[25:13] say like, write me a prompt. Oh, I have
[25:16] that here. Write me a prompt
[25:20] that shows a progression on a vintage
[25:22] audio equipment image.
[25:25] Let's see what it says.
[25:28] Let's see what that does. It might be a
[25:30] little too detailed,
[25:32] but who knows? It's good to experiment.
[25:37] And maybe we use it with
[25:40] this cassette tape because I'm going to
[25:42] do it on a cassette tape.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; And so Flux 2, you basically are
[25:48] exclusively using Flux 2 Pro
[25:50] &gt;&gt; right now. Yes. For image to for any
[25:53] image generation, it's like you don't
[25:55] have to be too deep about which model
[25:57] you use. like you just want to see it
[26:00] visually. And I found that Flux is quick
[26:02] and just good at like text prompts and
[26:05] it feels like very generically good. Um,
[26:10] and then I'll get into like a couple
[26:11] other models down the line when it
[26:13] becomes more important to like grab
[26:14] actual assets. Okay, this kind of shows
[26:16] us what it would look like to like have
[26:18] a more used cassette tape. And I do love
[26:20] the vibe actually. I'm obsessed. So now
[26:23] maybe we take this image we love and say
[26:26] um
[26:28] okay let's put that into flux again and
[26:30] the prompt is like show a more used
[26:34] version of this audio system.
[26:38] Um and again like there's always a more
[26:41] detailed in-depth prompt like you can
[26:43] always paste your prompt into claude and
[26:45] be like make this a better prompt and
[26:46] just kind of like experiment it with it
[26:48] like you would vibe coding. Let's see
[26:51] what it does. And then while it's
[26:52] generating, let's go back to Figma. Now
[26:54] we kind of have a visual anchor of the
[26:57] whole product. Like it should all kind
[27:00] of get more used as we
[27:03] use it, as the user uses it. Um, and
[27:06] like if we're going to go back to what
[27:08] the functionality is, we need to be able
[27:09] to record audio,
[27:11] see what you record, and have a timer.
[27:14] And now let's say that we have a color
[27:16] palette and we have a visual anchor. So,
[27:20] we sh we're probably ready to like
[27:22] actually work on the actual like assets
[27:25] and buttons now that we kind of have
[27:29] honestly like all the pieces put
[27:31] together. Like I actually love this so
[27:32] much. Oh my god, this is so pretty. Um,
[27:36] okay, cool.
[27:38] So, we could start with the buttons. Um,
[27:41] this is another prompt I kind of wrote
[27:43] out beforehand is like we need a record
[27:45] button. Um, and something I do a lot is
[27:49] I say to Claude like, "Okay, write
[27:51] different prompts of different types of
[27:54] record buttons." Like, we might want to
[27:55] try like a minimal version that's
[27:58] similar to this. We might want to try
[28:00] like a more intense version
[28:02] um that might be similar to some of
[28:06] these versions I did earlier. And you
[28:09] kind of just want to see what different
[28:10] buttons look like. So, I'm going to show
[28:13] you how these were generated over here
[28:15] because it's the same exact process we
[28:16] just used.
[28:18] So, you might take input as a color
[28:20] palette. You might want to take input as
[28:22] an as a as a um cassette tape. Any image
[28:26] again can always be your input. And then
[28:30] let's see what the prompts are. So, this
[28:32] is for example like generate a record
[28:34] button inspired by this cassette
[28:37] recorder. It should be like an analog
[28:39] button from the 80s. use this color
[28:41] palette. Um, and I've actually just like
[28:44] a quick I found that like a lot of talk
[28:46] online about AI is like how do you get
[28:48] consistent characters with like AI
[28:50] images, which is important and like
[28:52] challenging. But the nice part about
[28:54] product design is you don't need like a
[28:56] face to look the same. You just need
[28:58] colors, shadows, lighting to look the
[29:01] same, which is a lot easier. So, it's
[29:03] like a lot easier in app design and web
[29:05] design to make something like visually
[29:07] consistent with AI than like images
[29:10] you're generating of a person. Anyway,
[29:12] okay. So, we have a bunch of buttons.
[29:14] This one I really liked, but it makes it
[29:17] makes the background hard, I think, cuz
[29:19] it's not like on its own. Um,
[29:24] so my personal favorite ended up being
[29:26] just isolating this red one from our
[29:29] favorite image right here. What do we
[29:32] think?
[29:33] &gt;&gt; I couldn't agree more.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Simple. It makes It's like, you know,
[29:39] you go into like a Staples or whatever
[29:40] and they sell those like big red buttons
[29:42] that people want to press. Like that's
[29:43] what this feels like.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. Completely. I love it. It's so
[29:47] adorable. And I kind of like how it's
[29:49] like modern but not modern and analog
[29:51] but not like completely analog. Um,
[29:55] okay. So, we can kind of just go with
[29:57] this button. Normally from here, um, I
[30:01] would just download this image like
[30:02] straight from Weevi.
[30:04] Let's download it. They make it so easy.
[30:08] Um, and then into Figma, I would just
[30:11] paste it.
[30:13] And we're literally just starting to
[30:15] like save assets that we like. And so
[30:17] now we know that we like this button.
[30:20] Um,
[30:22] and we can deal with like typography and
[30:24] text and like all of that stuff after.
[30:26] And so if we're going to go back to
[30:29] like, okay, what do we need to build? We
[30:30] now have a record button. Um, we can
[30:33] deal with typography and text after. And
[30:36] we have kind of this like recording
[30:40] um speaker system. Clearly, I'm not like
[30:43] an audio person. Okay. Now, the big
[30:48] element we're missing visually, I guess,
[30:50] is the like history of after you record
[30:53] something, what does it look like? In
[30:55] our AI generated app, it's like a little
[30:58] list. But if we want to lean into this
[31:01] like analog
[31:04] whatever vintage cool system, we
[31:07] probably want like a metaphor for that.
[31:10] And luckily, we already have a metaphor
[31:12] for it, which is in the name. It's a
[31:14] cassette tape. So, we could just go back
[31:18] to one of these images. I actually
[31:20] really liked one that got generated
[31:24] here.
[31:25] And I'll show you how this was made
[31:28] from this color scheme, which was
[31:30] created the same way we did earlier.
[31:33] You could say, "Generate a set of
[31:35] cassette tapes using this color palette.
[31:37] Show the tapes from the spine view like
[31:39] they're stacked on a shelf." Actually,
[31:41] I'm kind of curious if we did that from
[31:44] this color palette. What would it do?
[31:47] Let's take this image. I love this
[31:48] image. It looks like it'd be like a cafe
[31:50] in Brooklyn. Um, and let's do flex
[31:53] again.
[31:54] And then let's do that same prompt I
[31:56] just pasted.
[31:58] Generate a set of cassette tapes. Let's
[32:00] see what it does. And then let's do the
[32:02] same thing from this one. I'm just
[32:04] curious.
[32:06] And I just kind of copy paste the same
[32:07] prompt over and over. And I also just
[32:10] love how
[32:12] we
[32:14] kind of tools are like meant to be
[32:15] really messy. Like it's meant to be I
[32:17] think really just a bunch of things
[32:19] everywhere. Um, and what's we haven't
[32:22] really talked about like the price of
[32:24] something like this. Like how much is it
[32:26] expensive? Is it cheap? Weebi.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Good question. It's pretty well priced.
[32:30] I think I think it's like 200 credits
[32:32] that are free every month. And okay,
[32:34] wait. I'm on the paid one, which is like
[32:35] $10 a month, I think. 15. And you get
[32:38] 1,500 credits cuz I use it a lot for
[32:40] work.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; But this you could do for free. Like you
[32:44] get like
[32:45] &gt;&gt; I mean this has taken us so far probably
[32:47] like 30 40 credits. So, it's kind of
[32:50] amazing, honestly.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; And see how good this is. Like, it
[32:53] literally just created all the cassette
[32:55] tapes based on the two color palettes. I
[32:57] think it did a pretty decent job. And
[32:59] then an idea is like, okay, we want to
[33:02] use these cassette tapes as the history
[33:03] of like each recording. So maybe we take
[33:06] this image, we do another flux prompt
[33:09] and we go um
[33:13] give me this same image but change the
[33:17] text on the binding to be a date like
[33:22] January
[33:24] 19th, 2026
[33:27] because then we can kind of keep this
[33:29] metaphor going and be like, "Okay, every
[33:31] time you do a recording, we have like a
[33:33] new cassette tape.
[33:35] show up on the screen. I did one earlier
[33:38] that I also liked. I'll show you guys in
[33:39] a sec once this generates.
[33:42] Actually, wait, I'll just show you now.
[33:44] Like this one, for example, the one I
[33:46] showed earlier, we took this image
[33:51] and it has like random text that it
[33:53] generated. And then I said, okay,
[33:56] replace the text with different dates.
[33:58] And it did it pretty nicely. So, you
[34:00] could kind of imagine like you'd give
[34:01] this to a vibe coding platform and then
[34:02] it would just like do it automatically.
[34:05] Let's see if it did it. Oh my god, it's
[34:07] so cute. Okay, I love it. See, you can
[34:09] kind of see the dates and then I mean
[34:11] some of them are a little off, but
[34:12] that's okay. These don't need to be
[34:14] perfect. So, now let's download this
[34:16] image. I'm going to download the one
[34:18] from here
[34:20] because it has a bit of a background
[34:23] color I like.
[34:25] So, let's download this image and let's
[34:28] paste that into Figma. Okay, we have
[34:31] these two visual references. So, now we
[34:34] pretty much have even though it's kind
[34:36] of hard to see, if you squint your eyes,
[34:38] you can see that we have like all the
[34:39] functionality visually. Like we have a
[34:41] record button, we have a speaker, and we
[34:43] have the history. It's just not in an
[34:45] app yet, which is fine. Let's do the
[34:48] logo, and then let's come back to the
[34:50] last step, which is putting the app
[34:51] together. Okay, this logo stuff still
[34:53] blows my mind as someone who has been
[34:55] designing logos their whole life. Um,
[34:59] where am I? Okay, let's go back to
[35:01] Weebi. So, now we're going to switch
[35:03] models. We're not doing ide. We're not
[35:05] doing flux anymore. We're going to do
[35:07] ideoggram.
[35:09] Super cool model. It's It's really good
[35:11] at typography, honestly. It's like
[35:13] amazing. So, okay, we're going to put
[35:16] this into Claude.
[35:18] And it basically says, "Write me four
[35:20] logo prompts." one that's like this, one
[35:22] that's like this, one that's like this,
[35:23] one that's like this, whatever. And
[35:24] let's see what it does.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; So, it says
[35:28] a technical word mark version A,
[35:31] handwritten, B, tape label, C, minimal
[35:36] word mark, D. Okay.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Do you like these?
[35:41] Maybe this one.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, I feel like that's the
[35:43] coolest. Like a version C, like a tape
[35:45] brand.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. Like I haven't even heard the names
[35:48] TD Key or Max Cell and Bass F
[35:53] &gt;&gt; but like I I it's actually probably like
[35:56] deep in my brain somewhere, you know?
[35:59] &gt;&gt; But like I I I I do like I think that's
[36:02] like what we're trying to evoke.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's go with this one.
[36:07] And then let's see. Oh, and another cool
[36:10] thing Logo does that Claude is good at
[36:13] is giving a negative prompt, which is
[36:15] basically what you don't want.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; Um, and so we don't want something 3D
[36:19] render glossy gradient mesh.
[36:21] Unfortunately, AI is ruining gradients.
[36:24] Um, sparkles like the you could just
[36:26] list a thousand things you don't want.
[36:27] So, that's kind of helpful, too. So,
[36:29] let's try it. You type idiogram v3
[36:35] and you're going to add the prompt which
[36:37] you picked which is like a really good
[36:39] one I think. Get rid of the version
[36:41] thing. And then the negative prompt.
[36:43] Let's just take clouds. I feel like it's
[36:45] pretty good. Cold, vinimal, corporate.
[36:47] True. Definitely don't want that.
[36:50] Negative prompt.
[36:52] Prompt. Okay, let's run it and see what
[36:54] he thinks.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; Let's run it.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; I just do ide for fun cuz it's so wild.
[37:00] Okay. So, flux for most things.
[37:03] Ideogram. Okay.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; I love it.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; That is really nice.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Isn't it so nice? I
[37:09] &gt;&gt; I can't even tell how to spell cassette
[37:11] anymore to be honest, but it doesn't
[37:12] &gt;&gt; I think it's two S's, right?
[37:14] &gt;&gt; I think so, but it doesn't matter.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my god, I love it. Um, let's do a few
[37:20] more. They're so fun. Like, you could do
[37:22] pretty much any.
[37:27] and then sometimes if you only like one
[37:29] prompt from Claude, you could be like,
[37:31] "I like this prompt.
[37:33] Make another one, but maybe we have a
[37:37] different style, but black and white
[37:38] only, cuz sometimes you might need a
[37:41] black and white logo."
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And like the gasp that you just
[37:45] had like oh my god is because you have
[37:47] been a designer your whole life and have
[37:50] spent so many hours, days, nights,
[37:52] sleepless nights, you know, thinking
[37:55] about all this. So the fact that it can
[37:57] get done for like the cost of like three
[37:59] pennies or whatever is just like mind in
[38:01] like one second is mind-blowing.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; No, it's it's so true. It's
[38:05] mind-blowing. Like really the only
[38:07] benefit of being a designer at this
[38:08] point is knowing maybe a little bit
[38:10] about what to react to, but that's
[38:12] really really minuscule. Like I think
[38:14] it's so insane. Like I'm not as obsessed
[38:18] with this, but still cool.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Cool. And then the other ones that got
[38:22] made earlier were also really cute. Like
[38:24] all of the I mean this one was bad, but
[38:27] this one's really cute. And you can kind
[38:28] of just feel out like what fits and what
[38:30] doesn't. And I mean the benefit of
[38:32] making a mood board and all the like
[38:34] earlier stuff of like how should it feel
[38:35] is it can let us look at this and then
[38:38] this and kind of decide okay this feels
[38:40] more the vibe.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Cool.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; So we have a logo.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Okay. We have logo. We're good. Um let
[38:50] me download this logo. Now we're pretty
[38:53] much ready for the final situation which
[38:56] is making the screens in Figma. Um, so
[38:59] in Figma, if you press F, you can get
[39:02] the frames. Let's just click iPhone and
[39:05] make a few iPhone screens. Add some
[39:08] border radius to be pretty.
[39:12] And I'm going to paste in a little top
[39:14] bar. Let's call it cassette.
[39:18] Just spell it differently everywhere.
[39:21] And then
[39:21] &gt;&gt; how did you paste the top bar for people
[39:23] who don't know how to do that?
[39:24] &gt;&gt; That's a good question. I have a really
[39:27] bad answer which is I have it in a that
[39:30] I used forever. But
[39:34] you can also Figma community search iOS
[39:37] and like every iOS component on the
[39:40] planet shows up that you can copy paste.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it's honestly more for it's
[39:46] like you don't need to do it here, but
[39:47] it just makes it feel so much more
[39:48] legit. Um and then let's bring these
[39:51] down
[39:53] so that we have like a bit of a side by
[39:54] side. Okay, what do we need to do?
[39:57] Record audio history of what you record
[40:01] timer. Okay, these don't need to be
[40:03] perfect. Let's first do record.
[40:06] Actually, let's just like add our logo
[40:08] in. Cute. The problem is that it's a
[40:13] black background and we don't want that.
[40:15] You can very easily in Weebi. Here's
[40:17] another tip in Weebi. You take the
[40:20] result, you type in background remove.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Oh wow. And it just does it right there.
[40:27] And we can redownload that.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; That's handy,
[40:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; So cute. Logo background remove. So,
[40:36] let's use that one instead.
[40:42] Very cute. And then we're going to want
[40:46] to color. Let's just use
[40:49] something like this for now. and we can
[40:51] change it cuz that doesn't quite fit.
[40:54] Something another tip that's Figma that
[40:56] I like to do a lot is anytime you have
[40:57] an image and you're trying to figure out
[40:58] your color, go here to appearance and if
[41:01] you go down and type overlay or hard
[41:04] light, you can kind of play with these
[41:05] blend modes and you see like it changes
[41:08] the color based on the background. So
[41:10] like even this for example feels a
[41:12] little better than that. Um but we can
[41:15] change our color after based on our
[41:16] color scheme. Let's just get the
[41:19] functionality down. So we have this like
[41:20] splash screen. Now let's do the record
[41:24] audio button screen. Let's just go ahead
[41:26] and paste this directly for now.
[41:30] And we can fix it later in terms of
[41:32] spacing and whatnot. Let's change the
[41:34] background. And now we need the history
[41:36] of what you record. Let's just paste
[41:39] this in
[41:41] and see how it looks.
[41:44] We kind of have the basics, but it looks
[41:47] like we need to change a couple of the
[41:50] backgrounds. There is actually one more
[41:52] cassette tape I liked better in our
[41:54] weevi that might work better. And now
[41:56] you only see it once you're in Figma.
[41:58] And it's this more simplified
[42:02] cassette tape here.
[42:05] This one I ran into the same thing
[42:07] earlier. Simplified cassette tape. And
[42:10] just for reference, I made that by just
[42:12] saying like generate a new row of
[42:13] cassette tapes. And so you you really
[42:16] just like iterate on your exact weebi um
[42:19] the more you go cuz in this one it's
[42:22] like a little hard to see the spacing
[42:24] and stuff. So let's make another one
[42:28] with simplified cuz that tape's
[42:31] adorable.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[42:34] &gt;&gt; right.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that looks really good.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; It's so cute. Okay. And maybe they can
[42:38] like horizontal scroll it. But we also
[42:41] need to unfortunately remove the
[42:42] background.
[42:44] Remove the background.
[42:47] And we're also going to remove the
[42:49] background of
[42:51] our favorite one, which is
[42:56] this one.
[42:58] Um, and that's kind of like a thing you
[43:00] should do all the time is make your
[43:02] favorite asset and then remove the
[43:03] background at the end once you're
[43:05] putting everything together.
[43:08] um to make it all cohesive. But while
[43:11] that's running, let's download this.
[43:14] Call it clean.
[43:17] Go back to Figma.
[43:20] Paste in clean.
[43:23] Paste in our logo
[43:26] at the top.
[43:28] Cool. So, this is our new version of
[43:31] history.
[43:33] This is our current little splash
[43:35] screen.
[43:37] And then let's get
[43:39] the one that we removed the background
[43:42] of down here. Oh wow, it removed
[43:45] everything.
[43:46] That's okay.
[43:49] I'll show you how to fix that cuz that
[43:51] happens really often. Now we have this
[43:54] little button. Sometimes when that
[43:56] happens, I actually just take this into
[43:57] Figma and remove the background.
[44:00] Background removal, it's like so common
[44:02] that you just kind of mess with it until
[44:04] it comes out right. Like honestly, if we
[44:06] just did it in Wavy again, it' probably
[44:07] work too. Um,
[44:11] now let's get the color scheme we want.
[44:15] We already have the color scheme from
[44:17] Weevi.
[44:19] Let's go back up to our color scheme.
[44:24] Just kind of copy rain shot, paste it
[44:28] here, and kind of eyeball
[44:32] a better color scheme that fits the
[44:34] vibe. Like
[44:37] something like that is nice
[44:41] to feel a little more warm.
[44:44] And now I guess we need text.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; We'll literally just look at the vibe
[44:50] coded one to kind of copy what text we
[44:52] need.
[44:56] or we can just look at what we need to
[44:57] do. So, you need to record audio,
[44:59] history, and timer. So, record audio.
[45:03] Oh, well, we're missing a record button.
[45:05] Now, we know from
[45:08] the history screen.
[45:11] Let's go ahead and add a cute little
[45:14] record button here.
[45:17] Maybe some T type. Some a helpful tip
[45:20] for mobile apps is like I would just
[45:21] keep the typography very simple and the
[45:25] same
[45:27] oops 20
[45:29] same tip as earlier. A helpful thing for
[45:34] typography is for colors use blend
[45:38] overlay and then it automatically
[45:42] is the color that fits well
[45:46] or that screen. See, like this
[45:49] automatically looks like it fits really
[45:51] well. And I just duplicated it.
[45:54] Something like that.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Do you ever think we'll get to the step
[45:57] where like the step before this, like
[46:00] the pre-Figma step where you'll just be
[46:01] able to put into Google AI Studio and
[46:03] it'll just like figure it out for you?
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Honestly, you could do that now. Like I
[46:07] think part of me likes compositing in
[46:10] Figma so that when I am going back and
[46:12] forth with Google Studio, I have a north
[46:14] star.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But like you could very much just
[46:17] literally get to this step, paste in
[46:20] these reference images to Google Studio
[46:22] and kind of see what it does. It might
[46:24] take a lot more similar to vibe coding
[46:26] like back and forth.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; I think it's similar to like how much
[46:30] back and forth do you want to have? How
[46:32] much of a vision do you have for it?
[46:33] Like this isn't a necessary step by any
[46:35] means. At the end of this, what I want
[46:38] to do is just compare what
[46:41] &gt;&gt; output versus Google AI Studios output.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, I think that's a great idea cuz I'm
[46:47] kind of curious like if we paste this in
[46:49] this in and like the logo, there is a
[46:51] logo I kind of liked better that was
[46:54] generated here that I do think we should
[46:56] use. Um,
[46:58] it's this little
[47:01] I think it's just that we need like a
[47:03] black and white one honestly for it to
[47:05] be really simple. But honestly, either
[47:08] would work. It's really just personal
[47:10] preference sometimes, but just so we
[47:13] have some less colors going on. Let's
[47:16] remove that background.
[47:18] And then the last text we'll add is
[47:21] library.
[47:23] And then paste it at the top. And there
[47:26] you go. Your app is done.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Download it at the app store right now.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Rate it. Fun stars.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; But I like that idea. Should we paste it
[47:38] into Google?
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Let's paste it into Google. And then at
[47:41] the after that, let's tell people if
[47:44] they actually wanted to make this
[47:47] fully functioning app, like how would
[47:48] they actually do that?
[47:50] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's do it. Remember you design
[47:54] the interface based on the logo color
[48:00] image
[48:02] of cassettes
[48:05] as history objects and
[48:11] record button
[48:14] attached. There's probably a much better
[48:16] in-depth prompt we could use and make
[48:18] this work really well to be honest.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Right. And we would go to a code or or
[48:22] another LLM to go and optimize that for
[48:25] us.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Like you could finesse it to
[48:29] the point where
[48:31] you have pretty much everything.
[48:34] Or you could honestly just like upload
[48:35] the Figma files too, but you really
[48:37] don't need to. And then you kind of see
[48:39] what it does.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then we wait.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; I wonder what it'll do.
[48:45] I mean,
[48:47] if it could do that, it would make a,
[48:49] you know, the lives easier for a lot of
[48:51] people. Um, the way I see it is it's
[48:54] kind of like, you know, do you want to
[48:57] There's like you can drive a manual car,
[48:59] you can drive an automatic car, or you
[49:00] can drive a self-driving car, aka you're
[49:02] not driving out at all, full
[49:04] self-driving.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Um, and you're just like managing the
[49:08] wheel. And like now it's kind of pick
[49:10] your poison based on like your level of
[49:13] comfort and all the and all these
[49:16] different tools.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Totally. And sometimes
[49:21] it's just like whatever comes up with
[49:23] the best output. Like you could design
[49:24] the whole thing in Figma and then
[49:26] suddenly like you get a one shot that's
[49:27] just better or vice versa.
[49:32] Like I found that shaders especially in
[49:36] Google AI Studio, it's like the one
[49:38] thing where I found that it just
[49:39] oneshots it so well that I'll almost
[49:41] never start with an existing thing.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; And then have you played or have you
[49:47] seen you know any of these
[49:52] mobile vibe coding app platforms like
[49:54] vibe code app or there's anything.com.
[49:57] Have you seen these?
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, it's a good point. I have seen
[50:00] them. I haven't played around with them
[50:02] in extreme depth. I've like tried a
[50:05] prompt or two.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; And I know they're getting better at
[50:09] backends and stuff like that, but that's
[50:11] usually always my um hold up with them
[50:14] is they'll feel like a little
[50:17] almost like the old version of no code
[50:19] sometimes. But honestly, they're getting
[50:20] so much better that I'm sure it'll
[50:22] evolve a lot.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. It's on my to-do list to
[50:26] like try it out. But I have seen like
[50:29] some of them are built on cloud on Opus
[50:31] 4.5. So it's like you got to think it's
[50:34] pretty good, right?
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, they're probably really good.
[50:38] And I feel like in the past 6 months
[50:40] like Claude has gotten so I mean I guess
[50:42] all the models but at least from what I
[50:44] use Cloud's gotten so much better at
[50:46] Swift and iOS whereas I feel like web
[50:48] used to really be like
[50:51] substantially better. Um, and now it's
[50:55] like really good at iOS, too.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; So, the for the mobile apps that you're
[50:58] building now, you're using cursor.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; I'm using Claude Code is my number one
[51:03] love of my life. My number two love of
[51:06] my life, cursor with Gemini model and
[51:08] plan mode. And then for oneoff shots,
[51:11] one-off prototypes, I'll use like Google
[51:13] AI Studio directly.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; You can only have one love of your life.
[51:16] You can't have two. That's That's
[51:18] blasphemy.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; No, you can't. But yeah, it's Claude.
[51:22] It'll always be Claude.
[51:24] Okay. What do we got? What am I looking
[51:25] at here?
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Let's see. I mean, it got the logo. It
[51:28] got the orange.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. Honestly, it's like much cuter.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, 100%.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Wow. Oh my god. Life is so crazy. I
[51:39] can't believe it does this.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's not perfect.
[51:44] And I still I think the Figma version is
[51:47] a lot better, but I I think that you
[51:50] probably can pingpong this to get to a
[51:52] point where it's almost if not Figma
[51:55] Figma level
[51:57] &gt;&gt; 100%. Also, like our prompt was so
[52:00] short.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And we're doing this live, so you
[52:04] could point is people listening, you if
[52:08] you want to go back to AI Studio, feel
[52:09] free. You don't need to be in Figma.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, 100%. Like if you spent one more
[52:14] minute than we did on the prompt, I
[52:16] would have done it.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Amazing. Um, Teria, anything else you
[52:21] want to leave people with? Anything else
[52:23] that you didn't cover that you wish you
[52:24] did?
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Um, good question. No, I would just say
[52:28] that spend lots of time on Cosmos. Spend
[52:30] lots of time gathering your own
[52:32] inspiration. Um, that's like actually
[52:35] just a lot of it. And then
[52:37] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[52:37] &gt;&gt; you can pretty much make anything you
[52:38] want. Yeah, it sounds like
[52:41] it feels like what I've learned is it's
[52:43] a game of kind of like collecting the
[52:46] right inspiration
[52:48] and
[52:50] then using
[52:53] like maybe sleeping on it and being
[52:54] like, okay, this photo, this picture,
[52:56] this and then getting the insights from
[52:59] there and then and then just bringing it
[53:01] back to AI Studio or Figma and and
[53:03] that's what it is
[53:04] &gt;&gt; 100%. It's so simple. It's like really
[53:08] you can take one visual reference and
[53:10] then just like make everything based on
