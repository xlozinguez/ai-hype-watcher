# Raw Transcript: Why $650 Billion in AI Spending ISN'T Enough

[0:00]

Google is spending $185 billion on AI Google is spending $185 billion on AI and it's still not enough. They just and it's still not enough. They just and it's still not enough. They just told investors that's how much they're told investors that's how much they're

told investors that's how much they're spending on AI Infra, and the stock spending on AI Infra, and the stock spending on AI Infra, and the stock dropped 7%. Not because Wall Street dropped 7%. Not because Wall Street dropped 7%. Not because Wall Street thinks the number is too high this time.

thinks the number is too high this time. thinks the number is too high this time. It's because Wall Street is starting to It's because Wall Street is starting to It's because Wall Street is starting to realize it might not be high enough. So, realize it might not be high enough. So,

realize it might not be high enough. So, Alphabet reported Q4 earnings on Alphabet reported Q4 earnings on Alphabet reported Q4 earnings on February 4th, the same week a markdown February 4th, the same week a markdown February 4th, the same week a markdown file erased $295 billion in enterprise

you had an application for railroads. you had an application for railroads. Fiber optics repeated that same pattern Fiber optics repeated that same pattern Fiber optics repeated that same pattern a century later. Between 1996 and 2001, a century later. Between 1996 and 2001,

a century later. Between 1996 and 2001, telecoms issued over $500 billion in telecoms issued over $500 billion in telecoms issued over $500 billion in bonds and laid 90 million miles of bonds and laid 90 million miles of bonds and laid 90 million miles of cable. And then the bubble burst and the

And then YouTube launched on bandwidth that cost YouTube launched on bandwidth that cost YouTube launched on bandwidth that cost almost nothing. And then Netflix pivoted

underpinned by the commitment to fiber in the 1990s. So that's been the in the 1990s. So that's been the in the 1990s. So that's been the pattern, right? Massive investment, pattern, right? Massive investment, pattern, right? Massive investment, crash, and discovery. But this cycle has

they're not really selling bandwidth. they're not really selling bandwidth. They're not selling storage. They're They're not selling storage. They're They're not selling storage. They're selling intelligence. Every inference selling intelligence. Every inference

[10:09]

selling intelligence. Every inference call is a purchase of cognitive call is a purchase of cognitive call is a purchase of cognitive capability. The model is the product and capability. The model is the product and capability. The model is the product and the infrastructure exists to serve the

the infrastructure exists to serve the the infrastructure exists to serve the model at scale. When an agent reviews a model at scale. When an agent reviews a model at scale. When an agent reviews a contract or writes code or manages a contract or writes code or manages a

flows through the model provider's API. flows through the model provider's API. The infrastructure and the intelligence The infrastructure and the intelligence The infrastructure and the intelligence are vertically integrated in a way that are vertically integrated in a way that

are vertically integrated in a way that railroads and fiber never were. And this railroads and fiber never were. And this railroads and fiber never were. And this means that companies building AI means that companies building AI means that companies building AI infrastructure are positioned to capture

infrastructure are positioned to capture infrastructure are positioned to capture value from the applications built over value from the applications built over value from the applications built over the top. Not just hosting fees, but an the top. Not just hosting fees, but an

the top. Not just hosting fees, but an actual share of the cognitive work those actual share of the cognitive work those actual share of the cognitive work those applications perform. That is a very applications perform. That is a very applications perform. That is a very different economic structure than any

different economic structure than any different economic structure than any previous infrastructure buildout. It previous infrastructure buildout. It previous infrastructure buildout. It doesn't guarantee that any of these doesn't guarantee that any of these

doesn't guarantee that any of these companies are going to win, of course, companies are going to win, of course, companies are going to win, of course, but it does mean the analogy to telecom but it does mean the analogy to telecom but it does mean the analogy to telecom companies going bankrupt is kind of

companies going bankrupt is kind of companies going bankrupt is kind of misleading. The model makers are not misleading. The model makers are not misleading. The model makers are not laying dumb cable. They're selling the laying dumb cable. They're selling the

laying dumb cable. They're selling the thing that makes all of our computers thing that makes all of our computers thing that makes all of our computers valuable. Now, there's also an important valuable. Now, there's also an important valuable. Now, there's also an important distinction in the AI infrastructure

distinction in the AI infrastructure distinction in the AI infrastructure conversation that most Wall Street conversation that most Wall Street conversation that most Wall Street observers have been missing, and it's observers have been missing, and it's

observers have been missing, and it's the key to understanding why the bubble the key to understanding why the bubble the key to understanding why the bubble to underbuilt narrative has flipped so to underbuilt narrative has flipped so to underbuilt narrative has flipped so quickly. The first wave of AI infra

quickly. The first wave of AI infra quickly. The first wave of AI infra spending from 2023 out to mid 2025 was spending from 2023 out to mid 2025 was spending from 2023 out to mid 2025 was primarily about training. Build those primarily about training. Build those

primarily about training. Build those massive clusters of GPUs. Train massive clusters of GPUs. Train massive clusters of GPUs. Train foundation models. Training is foundation models. Training is foundation models. Training is expensive, but it's also bursty, right?

expensive, but it's also bursty, right? expensive, but it's also bursty, right? You need a lot of compute for months and You need a lot of compute for months and You need a lot of compute for months and then the model's done. The investment is then the model's done. The investment is

then the model's done. The investment is very front-loaded. This is the phase a very front-loaded. This is the phase a very front-loaded. This is the phase a lot of the bears were analyzing when lot of the bears were analyzing when lot of the bears were analyzing when they called it a bubble. But the phase

they called it a bubble. But the phase they called it a bubble. But the phase we just entered is about inference. It's we just entered is about inference. It's we just entered is about inference. It's about running those trained models at about running those trained models at

about running those trained models at scale continuously for millions of users scale continuously for millions of users scale continuously for millions of users and frankly millions of AI agents 24 and frankly millions of AI agents 24 and frankly millions of AI agents 24 hours a day. Now, inference is cheaper

hours a day. Now, inference is cheaper hours a day. Now, inference is cheaper per unit, but it never ever stops. per unit, but it never ever stops.
