[00:00] Wall Street's AI panic is out of
[00:01] control. On Thursday, February 12th, a
[00:04] karaoke company managed to crash the
[00:06] stock market over AI fears. This is a
[00:09] company called Algorithm Holdings, and
[00:10] they put out just a press release
[00:12] claiming their logistics platform could
[00:14] help customers scale freight volumes by
[00:17] 3 to 400% without adding headcounts.
[00:20] Within hours, CH Robinson Worldwide, one
[00:23] of the largest freight brokerages on the
[00:25] planet, plunged 24%. The Russell 3000
[00:28] trucking index as a whole had its worst
[00:31] day since liberation day and billions in
[00:34] market cap evaporated across global
[00:36] logistics from Dallas all the way to
[00:38] Denmark. Algorithm Holdings has a market
[00:40] capitalization of $6 million. That is
[00:44] small for the stock market. It might be
[00:45] big for our bank accounts, but it's
[00:47] small for the stock market. It reported
[00:48] less than $2 million in quarterly
[00:50] revenue and a net loss of nearly $3
[00:53] million. Until 2024, this company was
[00:57] called the Singing Machine Company. It
[00:59] sold karaoke products. So, a former
[01:01] karaoke company worth $6 million at best
[01:05] just wiped billions of dollars off an
[01:07] entire sector of the global economy. And
[01:10] the part that should concern you is not
[01:12] just the absurdity. It's the fact that
[01:14] this is now the fifth time in 10 days.
[01:18] Each time in a different industry, each
[01:20] time triggered by a different AI
[01:21] announcement, each time following the
[01:23] exact same pattern. The pattern is the
[01:26] story, and the pattern has consequences
[01:28] that go far beyond stock prices. This is
[01:31] the AI scare trade, and we're going to
[01:34] get into it. The sequence of the trade
[01:36] matters, so let's follow it very
[01:37] closely. On February 2nd, Palunteer
[01:40] reported quarterly earnings that
[01:42] obliterated expectations. 70% revenue
[01:45] growth, the guidance of 61%
[01:47] forward-looking for fiscal 2026. CEO
[01:50] Alex Karp claimed Palanteer's tools
[01:52] could compress complex SAP enterprise
[01:55] migrations from years of work to as
[01:57] little as 2 weeks. And the stock jumped
[01:59] 8% after hours. The market heard the
[02:02] subtext. If one company can do that,
[02:05] every company selling enterprise
[02:07] software on a per seat basis is
[02:09] repricing. So the next day, Anthropic
[02:12] released new co-work plugins for legal
[02:14] work, contract review, compliance
[02:15] workflows, legal summaries. I made a
[02:17] video about this and what happened is
[02:19] that within 48 hours about $285 billion
[02:22] in market cap vanished from SAS, legal
[02:26] tech and data analytic stocks. The
[02:28] Jeffre Equity Trading Desk gave the
[02:30] blood bath on the stock market a name,
[02:31] the SAS apocalypse. And that stuck. That
[02:34] was just week one. Then the contagion
[02:36] jumped. Private credit and alternative
[02:38] asset managers like Aries, KKR, TPG,
[02:41] Apollo, and Blackstone all fell between
[02:44] eight and 10% on fears that AI could
[02:46] analyze deals and manage portfolios.
[02:49] Insurance brokers got hit next after a
[02:51] company called Insurify released an AI
[02:54] rate comparison tool. The S&amp;P 500
[02:57] insurance index posted its worst session
[02:59] since October. Wealth management
[03:01] followed the day after that, triggered
[03:02] by Altruist, a startup most people have
[03:04] never heard of, launching an AI tax
[03:07] planning tool. Raymond James fell 8.8%.
[03:09] Schwab dropped 7.4%. You get the idea.
[03:13] Real estate services came next. CBRE and
[03:16] Jones Lang Lasal each fell 12%. Kushman
[03:18] and Wakefield dropped 14%. Worst single
[03:21] day decline since the COVID crash. Then
[03:23] office REIT started bleeding on the
[03:25] theory that AI would reduce headcount,
[03:27] which would reduce office demand, which
[03:28] would reduce rent. And then the karaoke
[03:31] company came for logistics. So in 10
[03:33] days, the AI scare trade has burned
[03:35] through software, private credit,
[03:37] insurance, wealth management, real
[03:39] estate services, logistics, drug
[03:41] distribution, and commercial office
[03:43] space. Eight different sectors. Each
[03:45] sell-off was triggered by a different
[03:47] company in a different industry with a
[03:48] different product announcement. But the
[03:50] market's reaction was identical every
[03:52] time. Dump first, analyze later. Favuza,
[03:55] the Jeffre trader who named the SAS
[03:57] apocalypse the SAS apocalypse. credit to
[03:59] him described the broader dynamic in a
[04:02] note to clients on Thursday. For every
[04:04] corner of the market right now, there is
[04:05] an aggressive shoot first ask questions
[04:08] later for any area where there's an AI
[04:10] headline. He's right, but what he's
[04:12] describing isn't a market efficiently
[04:14] pricing disruption. It is something much
[04:17] more interesting and more dangerous.
[04:19] Fundamentally, Wall Street has developed
[04:21] an autoimmune disorder. The immune
[04:24] system risk repricing is attacking
[04:26] healthy tissue because it can no longer
[04:28] distinguish between what's real and
[04:29] what's not. And just like an autoimmune
[04:32] disorder, the damage caused by the
[04:34] immune response is now much worse than
[04:36] the disease it's reacting to. This is
[04:38] the mechanism of damage that we are all
[04:40] going to need to pay attention to. When
[04:42] CH Robinson drops 24% in a day, that
[04:46] isn't just a number on a screen for the
[04:48] 15,000 people who work there. That is a
[04:50] board meeting next week. That is a
[04:51] hiring freeze announced next month. That
[04:53] is the Q2 roadmap getting torn apart and
[04:56] rewritten around AI strategy. Whether or
[04:58] not the company actually has a coherent
[05:00] AI strategy. That is the CFO pulling
[05:03] forward cost cuts to demonstrate to
[05:05] investors that management does take this
[05:07] transition seriously. Stock drop doesn't
[05:09] just reflect reality, it creates
[05:12] reality. A company whose stock craters
[05:14] on AI fears is going to start behaving
[05:16] as if AI is an existential threat. Even
[05:19] if the actual tech is years away from
[05:22] threatening its core business, defensive
[05:24] postures get adopted right away.
[05:26] Innovation budgets get redirected from
[05:28] organic growth to performative AI
[05:31] partnerships. Headcount plans are going
[05:33] to get revised downward. Not because AI
[05:35] replaced anybody, but because the market
[05:37] priced in the expectation that it would.
[05:40] Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said
[05:42] Tuesday that the sell-off was quote too
[05:44] broad. JP Morgan strategists see
[05:47] potential for a software rebound based
[05:49] on quote an overly bearish outlook on AI
[05:51] disruption. They're all probably right,
[05:54] but the correction, if it comes, is not
[05:57] going to undo the organizational
[05:59] decisions that were made during this
[06:02] panic. The hiring freeze is going to be
[06:04] real for many of these companies. The
[06:05] roadmap pivot is going to be real for
[06:08] many of these companies and it's going
[06:09] to last for quarters. The budget
[06:11] reallocation is going to be real. The
[06:13] stock market may recover in a week or
[06:15] two. The strategic damage this is
[06:17] causing to these companies is going to
[06:19] take months or years to start to unwind.
[06:22] And in the meantime, there's actual real
[06:25] AI disruption going on that they need to
[06:27] respond to on a business time scale, not
[06:31] a market time scale. And those are two
[06:33] different time scales. The market is
[06:35] going to demand a performative response
[06:37] when they should be allocating resources
[06:40] to a strategic business response. And
[06:42] this is the reflexivity that almost
[06:44] nobody in the financial press is talking
[06:46] about. The scare trade is going to
[06:49] become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Not
[06:52] because AI is doing the disrupting, but
[06:55] because the market reaction to AI is
[06:57] forcing companies into this defensive
[07:00] crouch posture that makes them much more
[07:02] vulnerable to real disruption,
[07:04] ironically, from AI. So, the companies
[07:06] that respond to a 15% stock drop by
[07:09] gutting out their product teams and
[07:11] signing a splashy AI partnership are the
[07:13] ones that are going to get actually
[07:15] disrupted in 3 years, not by a karaoke
[07:18] company, but by a competitor that used
[07:21] this moment to invest in genuine AI
[07:23] capability and not investor optics. I
[07:26] want to be clear, the market is not
[07:28] entirely wrong, but it's hitting a fly
[07:31] with a hammer. It is catastrophically
[07:33] imprecise. The scare trade is treating
[07:36] every industry identically and that is
[07:38] the error. There are at least three
[07:40] distinct categories of AI exposure and
[07:43] the market is pricing every single one
[07:44] of them the exact same way which is
[07:46] incorrect. The mispricing here is where
[07:49] the real story lives for investors for
[07:51] founders and for all of us whose
[07:53] livelihood depends on any of these
[07:55] sectors which is increasingly well
[07:57] beyond tech. The first category is
[07:59] sectors where AI is genuinely displacing
[08:02] labor today. Software development is a
[08:05] clear example. Cursor, the AI coding
[08:07] editor, hit $300 million in annualized
[08:10] revenue, faster than almost any software
[08:12] product in history. It is well past 500
[08:14] million now. It continues to climb.
[08:16] Strong DM is famously talking about
[08:18] paying uh a,000 bucks for tokens per
[08:20] developer per day and no humans doing
[08:22] code review. It's easy for them to come
[08:24] up with those numbers because they have,
[08:25] I think, three engineers on staff at
[08:27] last count or something. Meanwhile,
[08:29] Palunteer's own numbers uh the 61%
[08:31] forwardguided growth for 2026 are proof
[08:34] that demand for AI native enterprise
[08:36] software continues to accelerate. So the
[08:39] SAS companies whose business models
[08:41] depend on selling seats to humans may
[08:44] well be in trouble. The market is right
[08:46] about them. I think not necessarily
[08:48] about the speed. Those businesses won't
[08:50] vanish overnight. And not about the
[08:52] data. You will still need somewhere to
[08:54] put the data. You will still need a
[08:56] single ringable neck. Comparative
[08:58] advantage still matters. You will not
[09:00] want to build everything yourself. But
[09:02] the assumption that all of software
[09:05] bottlenecks on humans is incorrect. And
[09:08] per seat pricing is in trouble. So those
[09:10] companies are going to need to adapt
[09:12] their business models to survive. The
[09:14] ones that don't are going to get
[09:16] repriced out gradually or disrupted
[09:18] suddenly. That's the category most at
[09:20] risk. That's the category I described in
[09:21] my SAS apocalypse video. The second
[09:24] category is sectors where AI may matter
[09:27] on a three to fiveyear horizon, but
[09:29] where the current panic vastly
[09:31] overstates the near-term risk. Wealth
[09:34] management is a really great example. An
[09:36] AI tool that does tax planning cannot
[09:39] replace a wealth advisor any more than
[09:41] Turboax can replace accountants. The
[09:44] value in wealth management actually
[09:45] isn't doing calculating work. It's the
[09:48] relationship. It's the trust. It's the
[09:50] behavioral coaching that keeps clients
[09:52] from panic selling during a downturn.
[09:54] And yes, I'm aware of the irony of
[09:56] wealth management clients panic selling
[09:58] their wealth management stocks because
[10:00] of AI fears. It is almost too perfect.
[10:02] Insurance brokerage is a similar
[10:04] business. Insurifi's rate comparison
[10:06] tool is useful, but the actual work of a
[10:08] commercial insurance broker involves
[10:10] negotiation, claims management, industry
[10:13] specific risk assessment. Current AI
[10:15] systems are not going to immediately
[10:17] replicate that. These sectors are going
[10:19] to change with AI, but they're not going
[10:21] to change overnight in the next quarter.
[10:24] The market is pricing in a gradual
[10:26] transition over the next few years as if
[10:28] it's happening by earning season and
[10:30] it's going to be catastrophic no matter
[10:32] what. That's just wrong. And if you
[10:33] think that's just wrong, wait till you
[10:35] get to the third category. The third
[10:37] category is where the market has just
[10:40] lost the plot entirely. A former karaoke
[10:43] company's press release about freight
[10:46] optimization does not invalidate CH
[10:49] Robinson's relationships with a 100,000
[10:52] shippers and carriers. Nor does it
[10:54] invalidate its proprietary data on
[10:56] freight lines and pricing or its ability
[10:58] to handle the physical, regulatory, and
[11:00] contractual complexity of moving goods
[11:02] across borders. commercial real estate
[11:04] services, CBRE managing billions in
[11:07] property transactions, they don't get
[11:09] automated because Claude can draft a
[11:11] lease summary. As Croup analyst Ariel
[11:14] Rosa put it about algorithm, quote, I
[11:16] would probably be more inclined to be
[11:18] skeptical that this particular company
[11:20] is going to be the one to disrupt the
[11:22] industry. I think Ariel was being very
[11:24] kind with that quote. But there's an
[11:26] important qualifier here. Eventually,
[11:28] disruption is going to come. The
[11:30] timeline the market is pricing in is
[11:32] delusional. the company they are
[11:33] choosing to react to is completely
[11:36] bonkers. But the idea that AI is going
[11:39] to have changes across every industry is
[11:41] not incorrect. The investment
[11:43] implication for all of this is pretty
[11:45] stark. The market is creating
[11:47] effectively a generational buying
[11:49] opportunity in some of these sectors
[11:50] while correctly repricing them in
[11:52] others. The skill is knowing which is
[11:54] which. And the answer is going to depend
[11:56] on understanding with specificity, not
[11:59] with panic, what AI can actually do in
[12:02] each vertical today versus what it may
[12:04] do in 5 years. Again, none of this is
[12:06] investment advice. I am not actively
[12:08] trading these companies. All I want to
[12:11] do is help everyone understand where AI
[12:13] actually is today, where AI is not, and
[12:16] how we can think about capital
[12:18] reallocation a little bit more
[12:20] intelligently because people's
[12:21] livelihoods really are on the line. When
[12:23] I talked about the idea that we all are
[12:26] affected as employees, as workers when
[12:28] these things happen, I'm not kidding. I
[12:31] have lived through situations where a
[12:33] market repricing has generated direct
[12:36] impact on headcounts, not because of
[12:38] business fundamentals, but because
[12:40] market perception is driving realities.
[12:42] That's wrong. We shouldn't be doing
[12:44] that. We should be thinking more
[12:45] intelligently about AI. We owe it to our
[12:47] businesses. We owe it to ourselves. We
[12:49] owe it to our employees. We owe it to
[12:51] our teams. So, let's dive into category
[12:53] one, the one that is most affected, SAS
[12:56] businesses. The scare trade is not just
[12:57] moving stock prices there. It's moving
[12:59] capital in ways that are going to
[13:01] reshape the competitive landscape for a
[13:03] long time to come. Let's follow the
[13:05] money here. Public SAS multiples are
[13:07] crashing. The S&amp;P software index is down
[13:09] roughly 20% year-to date, and privately
[13:12] held AI companies continue to ascend to
[13:14] valuations that would have been
[13:15] unthinkable just a year ago. Open AAI
[13:18] and Anthropic and XAI collectively are
[13:20] well over a trillion dollars in private
[13:22] valuation. Anthropic raised another
[13:24] several hundred million $300 million I
[13:26] think at a $380 billion valuation just
[13:28] this past week. Open AAI is likely to
[13:31] IPO at I would guess a trillion dollar
[13:33] valuation later this year. That is a
[13:36] guess. That is not a projection.
[13:37] Anthropic is in early IPO discussions as
[13:40] well. And global venture capital
[13:42] continues to skew toward AI with nearly
[13:44] half a trillion dollars deployed in
[13:46] 2025.
[13:47] This feedback loop toward AI away from
[13:51] SAS is very much self-reinforcing and
[13:54] vicious. Public SAS valuations are
[13:56] cratering. Private SAS valuations are
[13:59] compressing in sympathy because
[14:01] investors just don't see the future. And
[14:03] it doesn't matter if you are a SAS
[14:05] company with a creative and innovative
[14:08] approach to solving the Percy problem.
[14:10] If you get hung with the SAS tag, which
[14:13] was a benefit for all of the twins, it's
[14:15] now an albatross around your neck.
[14:18] Meanwhile, AI startups, regardless of
[14:19] whether they're good or not, look
[14:21] relatively more attractive to everybody.
[14:23] You stick AI in the name, and magical
[14:25] things happen right now. Magically, more
[14:28] capital will flow to the AI company that
[14:30] has AI in the name and releases an AI
[14:31] press release than to anybody else. It's
[14:34] not fair. It's not correct. There will
[14:36] certainly be lots of companies that go
[14:38] to the wall that were overfunded who
[14:41] have AI in the name and released an AI
[14:43] press release. But capital allocation
[14:45] typically isn't fair. And especially
[14:47] when we're talking about a chance to
[14:50] reshape the fundamental technology
[14:52] landscape in a way that we haven't seen
[14:53] since the advent of computing. Nobody
[14:56] wants to miss out. That is what is
[14:58] driving the obsession with getting into
[15:00] AI and out of SAS for investors. FOMO.
[15:03] for founders at SAS companies who are
[15:05] looking to go public. The window shifted
[15:07] or evaporated. The IPO pipeline was
[15:10] supposed to finally be open wide in
[15:12] 2026. And I would say that expectation
[15:14] has shifted out a year or more at this
[15:17] point. Not because the companies
[15:18] involved are worse, but because the
[15:20] public market's appetite for anything
[15:23] that looks like a traditional software
[15:25] business has just evaporated at this
[15:27] point. If your company is perceived as
[15:30] AI vulnerable, which it looks like
[15:32] everybody is in the market's eyes right
[15:34] now, and even if you've deeply
[15:36] integrated AI into your product, you're
[15:38] now fighting a narrative headwind that
[15:41] did not exist 3 months ago. And that is
[15:43] going to have again real implications on
[15:46] real lives. Some companies will delay,
[15:48] some will have lower valuations. It's
[15:50] going to change exits for employees,
[15:52] some will pivot to M&amp;A in the private
[15:54] markets. Wellington noted that the
[15:56] median time to IPO for companies valued
[15:58] above half a billion dollars has now
[16:00] stretched out to 11 years, the longest
[16:03] in a decade. The scare trade makes that
[16:06] number even worse. For AI native
[16:08] founders, the capital environment has
[16:10] never been better, but the scrutiny is
[16:11] way, way sharper. CLO went public with
[16:14] an AI powered story and is now trading
[16:15] near its first day closing price, which
[16:17] is down. The lesson is that AI powered
[16:20] is not a blank check long-term.
[16:22] Investors are interested in the AI
[16:24] story, but they need you to deliver on
[16:26] it in order to sustain capital
[16:28] valuations. Part of why hyperscalers
[16:30] continue to raise these rounds, I think
[16:32] anthropic was at a series G, is because
[16:34] they keep delivering on the revenue
[16:36] story. That is going to be an
[16:38] expectation even if you are one of the
[16:40] lucky ones with AI in the company name.
[16:42] So what does this actually mean for your
[16:44] career? Most of us aren't investors.
[16:46] Most of us are not capital allocators.
[16:48] Most of us are not founders. Here is
[16:50] where the conversation gets personal for
[16:52] people who work in tech or increasingly
[16:54] anyone who works in an industry that the
[16:56] scare trade has touched which is way
[16:58] outside tech. The most important thing
[17:00] to understand is that the stock price
[17:02] drop and the job risk are operating on
[17:05] different time scales but they are now
[17:07] feeding each other in ways that create
[17:09] real consequences for those of us whose
[17:11] jobs AI cannot yet do that are not yet
[17:15] vulnerable to AI. When your company's
[17:17] stock drops 15% on AI fears, the
[17:20] technology did not change at all. But
[17:23] the organizational response is going to.
[17:25] And so when every company is watching
[17:27] its peers get hammered in the scare
[17:29] trade, every company is going to be
[17:31] scrambling competitively to announce an
[17:33] AI transformation initiative that
[17:34] changes the market story on their
[17:36] company. The question you should be
[17:38] asking this week if you work in any of
[17:41] these affected sectors or frankly
[17:43] anywhere where the AI narrative could
[17:45] hit you, which if a karaoke company can
[17:48] crash the entire logistics market, I
[17:50] would say all of us need to be thinking
[17:51] about this because the market is being
[17:53] insane right now. The question you
[17:55] should be asking is where the AI budget
[17:57] for this AI transformation that your
[18:00] company is probably working on is coming
[18:02] from. Where is that money going to come
[18:04] from? If the money is net new investment
[18:07] layered on top of existing capabilities,
[18:10] that's a company positioning for a
[18:12] transition. But if the money is being
[18:14] taken from the product order or taken
[18:16] from the engineering team, the people
[18:17] who actually understand the business are
[18:20] optimizing for an investor narrative,
[18:23] not a product story that they can
[18:24] actually stand behind. One of those
[18:26] strategies, the first one, is going to
[18:28] potentially give you a shot at a
[18:30] competitive advantage if you execute
[18:32] that transition. If you incrementally
[18:34] invest in AI over the top of your
[18:37] existing capabilities, if you just start
[18:39] to steal money from your core technical
[18:41] teams, you're going to get a press
[18:43] release. You're going to get a headcount
[18:44] reduction, and you're going to have
[18:46] regrets. So, watch what your company is
[18:48] building versus what it's choosing to
[18:51] buy. If your company is saying, "We can
[18:53] buy some fancy tool and reduce headcount
[18:55] for PMs," you should be asking questions
[18:58] and polishing the resume. The scare
[19:00] trade is creating a really, really sharp
[19:02] split right now between organizations
[19:04] that truly understand what it takes to
[19:07] integrate AI into their workflows and
[19:10] are interested in learning what works
[19:11] and developing institutional knowledge
[19:13] about what the tech can do and what it
[19:15] cannot do in a very specific domain
[19:17] versus organizations that are in a panic
[19:19] that never understood AI where the CEO
[19:22] is reading LinkedIn posts about OpenClaw
[19:24] and they're just going to respond in
[19:25] that panic by announcing a partnership
[19:27] with an AI vendor and praying and hoping
[19:30] the stock recovers and then cutting some
[19:31] headcount. The latter is not a strategy.
[19:34] The latter is not responsible leadership
[19:37] and the latter is not going to lead to
[19:39] long-term company success. Ironically,
[19:41] the people responding to the AI scare
[19:43] trade, the leaders responding to the AI
[19:45] scare trade by panicking and announcing
[19:48] a narrative roadmap that is mostly
[19:51] spoken mirrors are going to be the ones
[19:53] most vulnerable to AI disruption later.
[19:55] While the builders meanwhile are going
[19:57] to develop a compounding advantage as
[20:00] they build into their current workflows
[20:03] and the models keep getting smarter and
[20:05] what they build keeps getting more
[20:06] useful. AI compounds for people who use
[20:09] it smartly. The buyers, the ones who
[20:11] want to just buy a tool and be done with
[20:13] it and have a narrative and announce a
[20:14] partnership, they're going to get a logo
[20:16] on the slide deck. But 12 months from
[20:18] now, the gap between the ones who are
[20:20] building and the ones who are just
[20:21] buying a vendor and praying is going to
[20:23] be very, very visible. Ironically, I
[20:26] think the people most at risk in this
[20:28] moment are not the ones whose jobs AI
[20:31] can replace today. Instead, they're the
[20:34] ones in any kind of cost center for
[20:36] companies whose stocks just dropped on
[20:38] AI fears. They're not going to look
[20:40] beyond is it a cost center. Is it in
[20:42] product? Is it in engineering? Is it in
[20:44] customer success? Anything that counts
[20:46] as a cost on the balance sheet. The
[20:48] market does not distinguish between this
[20:50] role will be automated and this role is
[20:52] at a company under AI pressure. both
[20:54] will get cut. Even though that's unfair,
[20:57] a corporate operations analyst at a
[20:59] logistics company that just dropped 16%.
[21:02] Is more immediately at risk than an
[21:05] identical analyst at a manufacturing
[21:07] company. Not because the AI threat is
[21:09] any different or because AI can
[21:12] immediately do that job, but because the
[21:14] stock pressure is different. The scare
[21:16] trade is a very, very blunt instrument,
[21:18] and blunt instruments create a ton of
[21:21] collateral damage that affects our
[21:22] lives. But there's a rosier side to this
[21:26] story. If you look carefully, there's an
[21:28] asymmetry here that almost no one
[21:30] sitting inside a panicking company is
[21:32] thinking about. The scare trade can be
[21:35] the best thing that could happen to you
[21:37] if you're positioned correctly as a
[21:40] professional in these businesses. Every
[21:42] company panicking about AI is about to
[21:44] spend heavily on AI capabilities. That
[21:47] spending creates roles, it creates
[21:49] budgets, it creates initiatives, and it
[21:51] creates career paths that did not exist
[21:54] a few months ago and that maybe would
[21:56] not have existed for a couple of years
[21:57] without this scare. So the person who
[21:59] spent the last year building genuine AI
[22:02] fluency, not just asking chat GPT to
[22:04] write the emails, but understanding how
[22:06] to integrate AI into business workflows,
[22:09] they're now in the position to bridge
[22:11] the gap between what the seuite is being
[22:13] told by vendors in the board and what
[22:15] the technology can actually do. That
[22:18] person, it might be you, just became the
[22:21] most valuable person in all of these new
[22:23] org charts that are being redrawn. The
[22:25] career move isn't learn AI. That's what
[22:28] we were talking about in 2024. It's very
[22:30] much table stakes now. And table stakes
[22:32] are not going to get you promoted. The
[22:34] career move during a scare trade like
[22:36] this is more specific and more urgent.
[22:38] Every company that just watch its sector
[22:41] get hammered and the ones who may be
[22:43] about to because I don't know that this
[22:44] is done. They're going to be asking the
[22:46] same question internally. What can AI do
[22:49] in our business? How can we get to
[22:51] workflows to data? How can we move on a
[22:54] timeline the board will accept? How can
[22:57] we get past a slide deck? Even the
[23:00] companies that are tempted to go with
[23:02] whisbang flash press releases typically
[23:05] do a little bit of work to try and make
[23:07] them real. And in almost every
[23:09] organization, the number of people who
[23:12] can answer that question with real
[23:13] specificity rather than just pariting
[23:16] vendor marketing or gesturing vaguely at
[23:18] the word like transformation. If the the
[23:20] number of people who can connect a
[23:22] domain, their expertise and artificial
[23:25] intelligence and where it's going, that
[23:27] number is vanishingly small at any given
[23:30] company. And that gap is the single
[23:33] largest career opportunity out there
[23:35] right now. Think about what happens in
[23:37] the next 90 days inside a company whose
[23:39] stock just got capped 12% on AI fears.
[23:44] The CEO is going to call an emergency
[23:46] leadership meeting. The board is going
[23:47] to demand an AI strategy. the chief
[23:49] strategy officer might put together a
[23:51] task force. We've all been there. We've
[23:53] read the headlines. They've got fear in
[23:55] their eyes. The person who is able to
[23:57] step up without fear in that world
[24:00] becomes indispensable. Not because of
[24:02] their old role, not because they're a
[24:04] machine learning engineer or a product
[24:07] manager or in revops, but because they
[24:10] are able to walk into a room of
[24:13] panicking executives and say, you know,
[24:15] I've been testing this. Here's what
[24:17] Claude can actually do with our contract
[24:19] review workflow. It handles about 70% of
[24:22] the initial analysis accurately. These
[24:24] are the conditional clauses it tends to
[24:25] miss. And this is where it cross
[24:27] references correctly and where it cross
[24:29] references incorrectly. And so we need
[24:31] to introduce a human check at this
[24:32] specific stage in the process. If we
[24:34] deploy it like this, we can cut our
[24:36] overall review time by 40%. And we can
[24:39] reduce outside council spend by maybe a
[24:42] fifth of a million dollars. And here's
[24:44] the implementation plan. Here's what it
[24:45] costs. Here's what it doesn't do. We're
[24:47] not going to overpromise to the board.
[24:49] This is a specific project we can do
[24:51] that has real impact on the bottom line
[24:52] today. That person does not exist in
[24:56] most organizations right now. The
[24:58] technical people understand the models
[25:00] but not the business. The business
[25:02] people understand the workflows but have
[25:04] never used the tools on a real world
[25:06] product and are often scared of the
[25:08] terminal. And so something like cloud
[25:10] code is scary to them. And the
[25:11] consultants often understand neither of
[25:14] them. They understand frameworks. So the
[25:17] gap between I've heard AI can do this
[25:20] and I've tested it and here's what it
[25:22] does for our company is a canyon and the
[25:25] scare trade just made crossing that
[25:27] canyon the most valuable thing anyone in
[25:30] the organization can do. The job here is
[25:32] domain translator. Really it won't get
[25:35] called that but that's what it is. And
[25:36] the scare trade has supercharged the
[25:38] demand for that role and compressed the
[25:40] timeline. 6 months ago, if you were the
[25:43] person who understood AI in your
[25:45] company's domain, that was a great
[25:47] career differentiator. You were setting
[25:49] yourself up well. Today, it's the
[25:51] difference between being on the task
[25:53] force and being on the layoff list. The
[25:55] concrete version of this looks different
[25:57] depending on where you sit. Obviously,
[25:59] if you're an ops, it means you've
[26:00] already taken your team's most
[26:02] repetitive workflow and you've run it
[26:03] through an AI tool, not as a demo, as an
[26:05] actual parallel process with real data
[26:08] tracking where it works and where it
[26:09] breaks. If you're in legal, product, HR,
[26:12] sales, it's the same principle. The
[26:14] person who has done the work of testing
[26:16] AI against real workflows in the real
[26:19] domains that they operate in. Those are
[26:21] the people who can articulate the
[26:23] results with precision. And those are
[26:25] the people the organization cannot
[26:27] afford to lose right now. The people who
[26:29] will get cut are the ones who cannot
[26:31] distinguish their work from what AI is
[26:33] able to do. If your contribution right
[26:35] now to the workforce is synthesis,
[26:38] reading documents, summarizing
[26:40] information, producing reports that
[26:42] aggregate other people's work, you are
[26:44] competing directly with a tool that does
[26:46] that faster and does that cheaper and
[26:49] the scare trade just made your CEO very
[26:51] aware of that. If your contribution is
[26:54] judgment, knowing which information
[26:56] matters, why the standard approach won't
[26:58] work for this client, what the model is
[27:00] missing because it doesn't understand
[27:02] the regulatory history or the
[27:04] relationship dynamics, well then you are
[27:06] more valuable now than you were a month
[27:07] ago because the organization just
[27:09] realized it can't automate its way to
[27:11] that judgment and it needs people who
[27:13] have it in the upcoming AI transition.
[27:16] Now, I'm not here to say organizations
[27:17] don't make mistakes. I have seen plenty
[27:19] of high judgment people incorrectly laid
[27:22] off. But the odds are better if you have
[27:25] that ability and if people know that you
[27:28] have it and it goes beyond AI. The
[27:30] asymmetry here is extreme. The scare
[27:32] trade is simultaneously destroying
[27:34] career value for people who were
[27:36] coasting on process work and creating
[27:38] tremendous career upside for people who
[27:40] can combine domain expertise with AI
[27:43] fluency. The gap between these two
[27:45] groups was growing anyway to be honest
[27:47] with you. But the stock market selloff
[27:49] made it visible to senior leadership to
[27:52] the seauite to the board in almost every
[27:54] company in America in the span of just a
[27:56] few days. And because of the prominence
[27:59] of the American stock market, there are
[28:01] boards all over the world looking at
[28:03] this. Now visibility like this is what
[28:06] turns a slow trend into an urgent
[28:09] capital reallocation in favor of AI. I'm
[28:12] not kidding when I say the AI scare
[28:14] trade is speeding up AI transformation
[28:18] by years at tens of thousands of
[28:20] businesses. The scare trade is a
[28:22] transfer of career capital from the
[28:24] people who treated AI as somebody else's
[28:26] problem to the people who have been
[28:28] invested in understanding it. The stock
[28:30] drops are just the visible part of that.
[28:33] The org chart reshuffleling is the part
[28:34] that determines your next 5 years. Look,
[28:37] AI disruption is real. It's not evenly
[28:39] distributed and the market's current
[28:41] method of pricing it, which is really a
[28:43] sectorwide panic triggered by press
[28:45] releases from companies with $6 million
[28:48] market caps. It's creating a mispricing
[28:51] so severe that it constitutes at the
[28:54] same time a historic investment
[28:56] opportunity and a historic reallocation
[29:00] of organizational attention. The
[29:02] companies that are going to lose in this
[29:04] new world are the ones that mistake the
[29:06] market's panic for a strategic signal
[29:08] and don't think carefully. The ones that
[29:11] choose to respond by gutting their teams
[29:14] and signing performative partnerships
[29:16] and praying that the stock recovers are
[29:18] going to be in trouble. The companies
[29:20] that win are going to be the ones that
[29:22] use the panic as cover to invest in
[29:25] genuine AI capability in the domain
[29:27] expertise that makes AI useful rather
[29:30] than generic. in the people who
[29:32] understand both the tech and the
[29:33] business well enough to know where real
[29:35] leverage lies. The scare trade is
[29:38] repricing the future. We can't do
[29:39] anything about that. The question is
[29:41] whether you're going to let the market's
[29:43] fear redefine your strategy or whether
[29:45] you're going to build the thing that the
[29:47] market will reward long term. The
[29:49] disruption is real. The timeline is
[29:51] completely bonkers right now. And the
[29:53] opportunity that that creates is
[29:55] unprecedented. And somehow an AI karaoke
[29:59] company helped to kick off all of it.
