[0:00] 3 days ago, I released a video showing every level of cloud code, and it took off. But I left out something critical that you need to understand if you're going to use it properly, and that's agent teams. Since then, I've dug deep into the official docs and been hands-on testing. And once this clicked, it completely changed how I thought about using claw code for my projects. Because if you're running it the way most people are as a single agent, you've probably noticed the same thing that I have. The longer it runs, the worse it gets. is forgetting context, introducing bugs, and forcing you to repeat yourself. So, in this video, I'll break down what Claude's agent teams actually are, why they exist, and when to use them versus sub agents or single agents, so that you can build reliable systems faster.

[0:43] So, let's get straight into it. More information you stuff into a single agents context window, the worse it performs, the harder it is for the model to focus on what actually matters right now. As this little context bar fills up, you get context raw. And when it gets to around 95%, it compresses and summarizes important information. And the next section of the conversation uses the summaries only. Meaning ultimately it can no longer find the key details that you gave to it thousands of tokens ago. Now imagine the damage this can cause on a much larger project where all of the key details matter and not just getting claw code to do an isolated task. So single agents get overwhelmed. they forget.

[1:21] And actually experts in the community spotted this problem early and they started building out their own sub agents. So you'd only use sub agents for two reasons with claude code. The first is to improve output quality. So think hiring a specialist versus hiring a generalist. We can have one claude that's just delegating to focused specialized instances in the same session that have their own context window. And therefore we can improve the output quality and also reduce the cost because we're not feeding in all of the context to those specialized sub agents. And the second reason is to get things done faster. So instead of having them feeding back and forth between each other, we would have them in parallel, two terminal windows open, taking on non-dependent tasks.

[2:10] So people like Boris Churnney, the creator of Claw Code, and other power users in the community, they were tackling this by building their own sub agent system. So Boris even said he ran up to 15 agents. So five in parallel in his terminal and then five to 10 claudes online at the same time. And this is great in theory, but it broke down when the agents actually had to communicate with each other. So sub agents can only report back to the parent. So if for example we had a content research team with a researcher as sub agent one, the writer is our main instance here and the reviewer is sub agent two, the sub agents, the researcher and the reviewer can only feed information back to the main instance, the writer. the reviewer can't review the research and the researcher can't see any outputs of the reviewer. The writer handles that all. So with sub agents, what you actually end up with is the main agent becoming the bottleneck here. There's only two-way communication between that main agent and every single specialist sub agent.

[3:01] So when we were spinning up sub agents, each sub agent has its own context and the results are therefore returned to our main agent. So in our case, the writer and we'd have the reviewer and the researcher as sub agents there. But the main agent is coordinating all of that work. So if multiple tasks and multiple sub agents feed into that main agent, that becomes the clear bottleneck. And this only works if you don't need the researcher to interact with the reviewer and vice versa. So sub agents acted like a hub and spoke model and they gave us delegation but they didn't give us collaboration and that's the gap that the agent teams actually fills and they do this through a shared task list.

[3:37] The main agent will decide and spin up the teammates or our sub effectively our sub agents here. But the difference is they have this shared task list which is able to communicate back and forth with every single teammate. And not only that, the teammates are able to actually communicate with one another. So think of it as a sub agent structure but with the ability to not only communicate with our main agent but also bring tasks down from the shared task list and communicate with each other. So again they have their own context window but actually instead of returning all the information to the main agent, they are set up as their own claude code instances. Now this comes with drawbacks. They have access to everything that the main agent has access to, the claw.md file, the MCPS, etc. But it comes at the expense that we have to put that all in the context of every single sub agent or teammate that we spin up. So it ends up costing more in tokens.

[4:26] So now you know what it is. Let's actually set this up. And by the way, it's still very experimental. So there's one thing we need to do first, and that's to enable it in our settings.json file. So we have a claude code instance already open here. Going to jump to our settings.json JSON file and we're going to replace that with claude code experimental agent teams as one which is true. And then we're going to need to make sure that we restart our claude instance. Before we restart our claude instance, we're just going to make sure that we have the latest version of claude. So we're going to run claude update. It's going to make sure that we're pass 2.1.32. Otherwise, you will not be able to use the agent teams even if you've got the flag in the settings.

[5:06] Now, when it comes to actually spawning a team, we can either tell Claude exactly what we want. We want a research agent. We want a writer agent, or just let it decide and give it a task scope. You have to specifically at this point tell it you want an agent team or allude to that in your prompt at least.

[5:20] Now, I walk through a few different use cases to try and understand where I'd use an entire agent team versus sub agents versus single agents. And I've got a few examples with business use cases, content creation that are like examples where I was like actually when it comes down to it, I probably wouldn't use the agent teams for this. And then cases where it gets more complex and more intertwined where the collaboration is more important, which would be kind of our six out of 10 or eight out of 10 use cases for using agent teams.

[5:45] So a two out of 10 use case would be effectively creating an agent team which pulls ideas from an air table content calendar. It spawns four teammates. One to write LinkedIn posts, one to write Instagram posts, another to do some deep research, and then a style reviewer to check the drafts. Now, that is something that's effectively a set of context prompts pulled together and does not require much collaboration between the LinkedIn post writer doesn't need to necessarily communicate with the Instagram post writer.

[6:22] A six out of 10 use case where there's increased amounts of collaboration could be content repurposing from a video transcript. So I could load in the transcript for this video. Teammate one is writing a long form blog post as markdown. Teammate 2 which is all about LinkedIn carousels and actually generating images, the hook and the storytelling angle for carousels. and then teammate three which might be writing an email newsletter tailored for your audience. So all of those are quite individual tasks. So those could be run as sub agents but the reason this is a six out of 10 use case instead of a 2 out of 10 use case is because actually you want them to be consistent in their output.

[7:20] And where agent teams really shine, what I call the 8 out of 10 use case is building something more complex when you definitely need collaboration. So a nextjs application with stripe. Teammate one is going to build the API layer with all the endpoints and web hooks. Teammate 2 is going to build just the front end. And teammate three is going to write a full testing suite. And actually throughout the builds of the API layer on the front end, they're going to be constantly talking to this testing to teammate 3 who's going to be doing the testing and then feeding that back up into the task list.

[7:54] Just so you can see exactly how this runs. We're going to copy this second use case here. And we're just going to specify create an agent team that. It's going to understand if we've restarted our instance in the settings.json, we've got that flag on that says we want to use teams. We've specified we want an agent team. And it's actually going to now go out and create those individual teammates.

[8:29] So it's going to grab the context and then spin up those individual teammates. We're going to see all those individual teammates working in parallel and we're going to be able to flick through those and you can actually talk individually and assign tasks individually to a specific teammate using shift up and shift down to specify the teammates. We can interrupt specific teammates. We can talk to them directly.

[8:57] Now, unless you have something like T-Max installed, they're all going to appear in this single terminal window. If you have T-Max installed, it's going to split out into individual windows, so you can see each agent's context being fed in and the work that it completes at the time.

[9:24] So it's got cross coordination built in already. The blog writer messages the carousel writer with their hook angle so they don't duplicate. The newsletter writer checks on the other two drafts to keep messaging consistent but takes a different angle. And all three follow the same brand voice band word list humanizer rules and no m dashes.

[9:50] Now the great thing here is actually it has in the same window all of the actions that are taking place. So we've got the actions for example of the carousel writer here. Then we can see the actions of the blog writer and both of these are being run simultaneously at the same time.

[10:56] So literally one setting in our JSON settings, one prompt and you've got a coordinated team of AI agents working in parallel and they're all communicating with each other. But the important thing is to understand which tasks actually are suitable for a team and which should just be using sub agents or single agents.

[11:15] Now let's quickly talk about some of the potential limitations of using this team approach. Now first is no context inheritance. So teammates spun out don't get that conversation history from your main workflow. Permissions do propagate. So if we start with bypass permissions on, they will be passed to all of the teammates. Of course, with the cross collaboration between teammates, we're effectively spending more tokens. More agents equals more tokens. So, only use it when the task is that 8 out of 10 or 7 out of 10 and actually deems an agent team necessary.

[12:07] So, the question is then, when do I use agent teams versus sub agents versus just a single agent? The way that I'm going to treat this going forward is straightforward tasks where I have one file or a couple of context files, one feature and one conversation. I'm going to use a single agent and I can ask that single agent to spin out sub agents too if I need specialists and effectively my context is getting too large for a single agent conversation. I will expand that to sub agents where we can improve the quality and reduce the cost for that level of quality. But when I need a more complex task like building out a SAS application, then I'm going to need speed and coordination where parallel tasks are taking place and agents need to talk to each other, then I'm going to use agent teams. So in simple, start simple, graduate to sub agents as the project gets more complex and then reach for agent teams when the task genuinely needs that cross collaboration.
