After you install the skill and you need to launch cloud code in any of your IDE that being cursor, anti-gravity, warp or even your terminal as you see right here. Yeah, I'm going to just put here forward slash ads for example. My goodness ads right here. And I'm going to choose let's say ads plan for the sake of this demo. So right now what will happen? I'm going to plan an ad for let's say for my SAS uh for ranking standard pro because it's brand new. It's there and I would like to promote it. I want to build that

[1:00] brand awareness. So here I'm going to just even zoom in so you'll be able to see like it's asking what type of business are you you're are you planning ads for SAS e-commerce local B2B. I would choose because it's a SAS Frankenstein is a SAS. What is your primary advertising goal here? I would choose brand awareness because it's it's it's just brand new. Yeah, it's asking also what is your advertising budget range under 5K over 20 or 100? We're going to just choose other. I'm going to put here 1,00 100 $1,000 for example per month here. Are you currently running

[1:00] any paid ads? No. Starting fresh. Submit answer. And that's it. Right now, oh my goodness. Right now the the agent is uh is running. I just I just pressed the wrong button, guys. So right now the agent is running and straight away it's asking, hey, can I read these? Yes. Yes. Yes. We're just going to put even this. I'm going to change to bypass permission right here. So don't need to always press on accept. So he's reading these files basically the skills. How can I just show right here? So he's reading the SAS MD file, the budget allocation and also conversion tracking. Yeah, cuz

[2:00] before he asked us some questions, we answer. We just press yes, no, yes, no, maybe, perhaps. And then afterwards, he checked his skills. He's like, uh-huh. Okay, so it's a SAS. He has a budget over one one around $1,000, give or take, and other questions. Right now, straight away, he's asking another list of questions right now. Yeah. So, is your SAS product at B2B selling uh to businesses or B2C selling to consumers? So we're going to put here both PLG. No, hey, can you produce short video content? So hey, can you or you cannot I mean anyone can build can create short

[2:00] videos but uh some of them maybe cannot. Maybe they're too shy to speak back right now. Yeah. So let's say here I'm going to choose yes in house I can create videos for internal sources. Next is choosing what does your SAS product do and who is the ideal customer. So here I'm going to just put here uh check rankenstein.pro website. Yeah because this is the website of rankenstein.pro. I mean it's more than enough in this case scenario if let's say if you're a plumber or if you have plumber or some local other local service or maybe an e-commerce site you can just put your website link and as you can see right now here you

[3:00] can see that hey it's web patching right now running pro which is the website itself then he's thinking so here you can see like hey now I have all the data now I have all the data I need let me craft a realistic honest strategy for SAS company with $1,000 per month budget focused on brand awareness starting fresh yeah based on the questions that we answered before and here is key consideration s 1,000 per month brand awareness starting fresh need to be very focused one platform max maybe maybe two of them right now yeah so with 1k per month for sales brand awareness so

[3:00] LinkedIn is too expensive Google search is conversion focused meta Facebook Instagram is the best for awareness and low budgets and YouTube could work for awareness but needs video content Tik Tok will work if they have video content capability right now yeah this is also based on his internal knowledge and now he's starting crafting the ads for us so look at that So even he's thinking I'm going to even again zoom in so we be able to see. So now I have a clear picture ranking pro a SEO content engine. So if I'm going to go right now to rankstein pro just going show you

[4:00] around. So I'm going to go here ranking pro. This is one of the ses we're currently building me and Benjamin. Um it's basically it's a blog creator right now. Yeah. So he scripted the site. So he enter on this website. He checked the homepage. He already got exactly what this business is about and then he started crafting the the ads plan for us. I'm going to zoom in back so I'll be able to see exactly his thinking because it's very important guys. Uh maybe if you're used let's say to these workflows perhaps. Yes. Nan is also amazing. I will not deny it. But here I mean if you

[4:00] want to go to the new age cuz I would say these agentic workflows they're fantastic if you know exactly how to set them up. Yeah. So he created a plan for us. So he's like hey update to create an ad strategy uh campaign architecture create a budget plan and then a creative brief right here. So maybe let's say you don't want to go for LinkedIn. Maybe you want to go for let's say YouTube only YouTube. You can definitely just say to a message, hey listen, I want to go only for YouTube. I'm damn all in on YouTube for example. Right now you or maybe if you want to go only for Google ads it's

[5:00] just a matter of sentence if it's just a matter of thoughts a pro a prompt really. So just put a prompt anything you want you can do that. Also if you want to have a PDF you can do PDF. If you want to connect it through an MCP server strapped away to Google Analytics you can also do that. So you can easily just build on top of this uh cloudy ads skill with ease. So anything you want can be done only if you request it properly. So for that it's required a little bit of content engineering but I think anyone can do that because I think you're texting every day right on

[5:00] WhatsApp or messengers or Instagram. So definitely you can do that. You just give it some time. you just uh check here and there and it going to give for you the perfect perfect plan and so you can create the best performing ads right so I'm going to just stop right now I'm going to fast forward so we're going to see the results okay guys so currently he has finished and let's see exactly what he crafted right here I'm going to even zoom in right now and here we have a strategy overview here is platform meta only Facebook and Instagram the

[6:00] right call at $1,000 per month so he thought about our let's say budget In this case scenario was 1,000 cuz if I would have provided let's say maybe 2,000 3,000 or 4,000 of course he would recommend maybe Google ads or any other ads and Google search 1.5k if you want to go but are too expensive for this budget. So expected results at 1K per month is 70 80,000 impressions per month. 11K video views okay per per month uh 200 400 website visits per month and also cost per 1k reaches

[6:00] around $25 to $33 which is quite well you know so deliverable created but here we have the ad strategy it's a full strategic plan so competitive landscape platform rational. So if I'm going to open this right now here you can see it's a markdown file by the way because Claudia he likes markdown. He's digging markdown like crazy. Even his skills are in markdown. But let's say maybe for you cuz maybe you're a nontechnical person. You don't like markdown. Guys, don't worry. You just close this. You go here and say, "Hey, I want to have a PDF well

[7:00] set and designed with graphs for example right now." Yeah. And that's it. Right now, we can just wait for it to craft a PDF. So, it's going to be easier for us to read it. And if you want to have anything else except the images and videos because cloud cannot generate those images yet. or if you want to maybe connect an MCP server to it or maybe some API keys to generate those videos even you can do that here. The only limit is your imagination. So let's wait for a bit. If you want to convert now everything into a well set uh PDF and I'm going to show you in a bit. Okay

[7:00] guys, so the agent just now finished and let me show you exactly what I popped. But before that, let's see through his thinking for you to understand exactly how he generated the PDF. I'm going to try to zoom in. So let me show you just around. So here he's like hey I'll create a professional design HTML report charts and convert it to PDF right here. So he's going he's doing his thinking he's analyzing and then he's creating the Python script by the way uh for the PDF uh generation and then he's generating the PDF report with charts. Going more down he has created the PDF and then he's generating the PDF with

[8:00] charts and then he's reading each and every part of PDFs right here. If you want to open even he created here the the charts etc. So he's like, "Oh wait a moment. Uh there are a few stuff which are not proper, not well arranged. Let me fix that." And then he checked those and he fixed those by himself. I was not here at all. So this whole process took like around how long? Maybe 3 minutes I would say for him to generate this full PDF. So let me try to open it right here. Where was it? Right here. This is exactly what sort report he has created even in the style of

[8:00] Frankenstein. So let's see around. So paid advertising strategy. Super ranking standard pro AI SEO content engine strategic plan right monthly budget platform meta goal awareness timeline 12 weeks cool cool nice prepare for Daniel and Benjamin here we go right now so here we have the executive summary for the rockenstein bud budget reality right now he's also competitive landscape he checked for competitors guys how cool is that so he's not just fluffing here not

[9:00] just oh my goodness he researched online the internet he checked for competitors And beautiful you got we got also information about the competitors also right here and going more down messaging wedge. So the only AI content engine that starts with SER research, not the blank prompt because that's correct. And we have the overall ads plan right now even with charts even in our own style if really okay launch now lowest CPM is in January January March. So let's say it want to start right now. Um do wow

[9:00] wow I mean beautiful beautiful report beautiful charts if really I mean this is mostly like what a what an ad agency is doing and afterwards I can just build on top of that we have a full plan of action in regards to advertisement is giving us metrics is giving us what to do I'm like and of course if you want something else maybe you want to go for meta you can just easily say hey listen I don't want to go for meta but I want to go for Google ads with YouTube I'm going to make a lot of shorts and I want to do it for 2 weeks. Let's plan that.

[10:00] Of course, you can do that one also. As I mentioned before, your only limit is your imagination. So, with that, let's say if you have maybe some existing ads, maybe I'll even I'll try the way even to launch this on the current ads video. So, I'm going to use cloudy ads to run ads on this video. So, if you've seen this video through an ad, I mean, you can see exactly it targeted you in a way. But, uh just saying you like, hey, everything is possible. It's not like, oh my goodness, it's put in stone. I will do only these. Uh if you want to have anything else, maybe you want to have some feedback on the ads that

[10:00] you're currently creating or the you the videos on Tik Tok or whatever you're doing, even pictures. And if you want to have maybe some text, some titles, some descriptions, some research in regards to those ads, Cloudy Ads can do that for you. So even now, I say like, hey, I want to go for YouTube. How should we speed the $1,000 between Google search and YouTube? Right now, yeah, let's go for 6040 recommended as per cloudy code. He has that knowledge because his whole base knowledge I'm going to show right here. It's based on the search. Here we have four documents. Again, I'm going to zoom in. So, four documents right here

[11:00] that uh this whole agent skill was created from. It's over 2,500 websites by the way, give or take, in regards to the best ads practices. And again, of course, it's in markdown because Cloudy likes markdown. And guys, this is just one example how I'm planning ads with cloud ads. But of course, you can do a lot more. I will even try to zoom in this part right here. You can also read the git. So you can go once again to the git, try to install these ads if you want to run any sort of ads. You don't need to have a budget for,000 just for

[11:00] information. You can do even for $50 or $100 if you want to bring some more clients. But I know for sure that this scale will definitely help you in the long run. So I'm going to make myself a little bit bigger right here. Almost almost almost almost maybe here like this and like this guys once again this is cloudy ads as you see right here it's the ultimate ads agency skill you can say for cloudy code uh you can just download it is there for free for you guys so uh you can run it you can test

[12:00] it you can make it even better try to fork it try to maybe make some improvements maybe not only Python maybe you can add also here some MCP servers but it's there and I hope you're going to like it drop a like drop a comment
