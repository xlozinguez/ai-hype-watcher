[00:00] AI has been the hot topic for the past
[00:02] few years, but it seems like nobody's
[00:04] noticed that it's actually just medieval
[00:07] alchemy. Duh. We're all so busy
[00:10] scrambling and trying to figure out how
[00:12] AI is going to change everything when
[00:14] all we need to do is look a thousand
[00:16] years into the past to figure it all
[00:18] out. You're of course already familiar
[00:20] with what artificial intelligence is.
[00:22] So, your first question here is
[00:23] probably, what's alchemy? Well, to the
[00:25] medieval mind, alchemy was this weird
[00:28] specialized branch of natural philosophy
[00:31] that thought it could uncover all the
[00:32] deepest secrets of nature. Alchemists
[00:35] basically wanted to create an agent of
[00:37] perfection, something that could turn
[00:39] lead into gold and cure human illnesses.
[00:42] Coincidentally, just like Sam Alman,
[00:44] they tried to constantly sell everyone
[00:46] on the future implications of their
[00:48] experiments instead of what was actually
[00:50] doable in the present moment. You might
[00:53] use AI all the time. I know the
[00:55] corporate world and American
[00:56] universities pretty much run on chat GBT
[00:59] at this point, but could you actually
[01:01] explain to me in an indepth way how
[01:03] these large language models work? And
[01:05] before you copy paste some long
[01:07] Wikipedia answer into the comment
[01:09] section, the answer is no, because even
[01:11] the engineers who built them don't fully
[01:14] understand how they work. This is called
[01:16] the blackbox problem. You see, these
[01:18] engineers designed the architectures and
[01:20] training processes for something like
[01:22] chat GBT. But if you were to ask them,
[01:24] they don't actually fully understand the
[01:27] internal logic of how these models
[01:29] arrive at specific outputs. Wouldn't you
[01:31] believe it? Flying blind like this is
[01:34] actually an incredibly medieval concept.
[01:36] Medieval Europe was a truly god-fearing
[01:39] place in a way that not even the most
[01:41] religious among us could imagine today.
[01:43] Everything was completely steeped in
[01:45] Christianity, including alchemy. And the
[01:47] alchemists saw themselves as co-creators
[01:50] with God who could change the very
[01:52] essence of matter from one thing to
[01:54] another. One of their main pursuits was
[01:56] to discover the philosopher stone. Shout
[01:58] out all my potter heads, which was a
[02:00] concept that dates all the way back to
[02:02] the Greek mystic Zimos of Paniplo in the
[02:05] 4th century. Basically, the alchemist
[02:07] figured they could create this legendary
[02:09] substance. Not only would it turn lead
[02:11] into gold, it would also heal all
[02:13] ailments and give human beings
[02:15] immortality. Like I said, medieval
[02:17] Europe was extremely Christian. And if
[02:19] you've ever read the Bible, you'll
[02:20] notice that a lot of the patriarchs in
[02:22] the Old Testament apparently lived
[02:24] incredibly long lives. We're talking 8
[02:26] or 900 years. So, if you're a medieval
[02:29] alchemist reading this, it's not crazy
[02:31] to think that maybe those biblical
[02:33] patriarchs had access to some secret
[02:36] that you need to discover. Elias Ashol
[02:38] was a 17th century alchemist, which is a
[02:40] little outside the boundaries of the
[02:42] Middle Ages, but he was drawing on
[02:43] medieval knowledge when he claimed that
[02:45] the history of the philosopher stone
[02:48] went all the way back to Adam, who
[02:49] learned about the stone directly from
[02:51] God. This information was then passed
[02:53] down through Moses and Jacob and all the
[02:56] other main characters in the Old
[02:57] Testament, but it had been lost
[02:59] somewhere in the distant past. Also,
[03:01] alchemy wasn't just a Western European
[03:03] pursuit either, and it was actually the
[03:05] Byzantines in the east along with Arab
[03:07] scientists who initially picked up where
[03:09] the Greeks left off. I'm going to get a
[03:11] little technical here for a second, but
[03:12] just stay with me because I promise this
[03:14] all links back to AI. There was this 8th
[03:16] century Muslim alchemist named Jabir
[03:19] Iban Hayan, and he was big on the idea
[03:21] that every metal was a combination of
[03:23] fire, earth, water, and air. So if you
[03:26] can imagine that all metals have some
[03:28] combination of these four basic
[03:30] properties, you should theoretically be
[03:32] able to transmute one metal into another
[03:35] by rearranging these properties. That's
[03:37] how you would be able to turn lead into
[03:39] gold. The change could only happen from
[03:40] some outside substance which was called
[03:42] zerion in Greek and alixier in Arabic
[03:45] which was latinized into the word
[03:46] elixir. This elixir, Jabir figured, was
[03:49] some sort of powder and you could
[03:50] somehow make it from the philosopher
[03:52] stone. In the same way, a modern neural
[03:55] network is just a bunch of dead math
[03:57] until you apply the elixir of training
[03:59] data and optimized weights. That is what
[04:02] transmutes the code into something that
[04:04] feels alive. The responses you get from
[04:06] your AI agent. Now, I want to give
[04:08] credit to our medieval ancestors here
[04:10] because there were plenty of thinkers
[04:12] throughout the Middle Ages who called
[04:14] bull on all of this. There was the
[04:16] legendary Persian philosopher Avisa who
[04:18] was also an incredibly influential
[04:20] physician and he basically tore this
[04:23] whole alchemy theory down saying those
[04:25] of the chemical craft know well that no
[04:28] change can be affected in the different
[04:30] species of substances though they can
[04:32] produce the appearance of such change.
[04:35] To put it simply, he's saying it's easy
[04:37] to drum up hype and sell people on the
[04:39] idea of this magic process, but those
[04:41] who had actually worked with this stuff
[04:43] knew that it was impossible. That brings
[04:45] us to our current AI problem. Now, the
[04:47] title of this video says that AI isn't
[04:49] the future, but I'd like to clarify that
[04:51] I'm not some lite and I'm not actually
[04:53] against AI technology generally. It does
[04:55] seem to have some beneficial use cases,
[04:58] especially in the medical field. And I
[04:59] think it is something that's going to be
[05:00] part of our existence for the
[05:02] foreseeable future. What I am saying is
[05:04] that history teaches us that we should
[05:06] be wary of any miraculous thing that's
[05:08] going to fix all of our problems in one
[05:10] fell swoop. All you need to do is look
[05:12] at medieval alchemy, which proves that
[05:14] this pursuit of perfection is part of
[05:16] the human psyche, and it's never quite
[05:18] worked out the way it was supposed to.
[05:20] There's this insane book that came out
[05:22] recently called On the Future of
[05:24] Species, and it's all about how AI is
[05:26] literally primed to create synthetic
[05:28] life. Is it ethical? Who cares? We can
[05:32] finally perfect the human genome and
[05:34] create a race of super soldiers. But
[05:36] before we get to that, I mentioned
[05:37] earlier the black box, the place where
[05:40] complexity hides the truth. To be
[05:42] totally honest, I've been dealing with a
[05:44] version of that in my own personal
[05:45] finances. I'm the type of person who
[05:47] signs up for free trials to test out new
[05:50] editing tools or research archives and
[05:52] then completely forgets to cancel them.
[05:54] And that's why I'm so excited to tell
[05:55] you about today's sponsor, Rocket Money.
[05:58] As someone who gets easily overwhelmed
[06:00] by multiple accounts, their singular
[06:02] view feature has been a lifesaver. I
[06:05] securely linked my checking, savings,
[06:07] and even my business accounts. And now I
[06:09] have a single dashboard to monitor my
[06:11] overall financial health without logging
[06:14] into four different portals. But the
[06:16] best part for me is the subscription
[06:18] management. Rocket Money automatically
[06:20] tracks every recurring charge I have and
[06:22] puts them in one consolidated list. It's
[06:25] helped me stay on top of those forgotten
[06:27] trials I mentioned earlier, and it even
[06:29] helps me cancel them with just a few

[06:47] So, you know how I said before that
[06:52] with God? Well, they believe that
[06:53] everything is made of a base prima
[06:56] materia that can be broken down and
[06:57] reorganized. In his new book on the
[06:59] future of species, the genomic
[07:02] entrepreneur Adrien Wolfson says that
[07:04] with AI, we're making this alchemist
[07:07] dream an actual reality. For my money,
[07:09] the term genomic entrepreneur sounds
[07:12] incredibly dystopian, but I guess that's
[07:13] beside the point. Wolson writes, and I
[07:15] quote, "The impulse to blend the
[07:17] anatomical traits of other species with
[07:20] those of humans appears to be hardwired
[07:23] into our imagination." And he's totally
[07:25] right. In the Bible, the prophet Ezekiel
[07:27] sees four beasts emerge from a burning
[07:30] cloud. Each has wings and four faces.
[07:33] That of a man, a lion, an ox, and an
[07:35] eagle. There was also the creature
[07:37] Barack, a fusion between a mule and a
[07:39] donkey with wings and a human face that
[07:41] was said to have carried Muhammad on his
[07:43] journeys. Wolson claims that with the
[07:45] new neural network technology of
[07:47] Alphafold 2, we can take the structures
[07:50] of complex proteins and actually predict
[07:52] them. That means we would be able to
[07:54] create new ones. And if we can create
[07:56] new proteins, that would suggest that we
[07:58] can create new forms of life. One more
[08:01] quote from Wolson here. He says,
[08:03] "Biology now stands at the threshold of
[08:06] transitioning from a largely descriptive
[08:09] science into a generative one." Dude,
[08:11] this is literally just medieval alchemy.
[08:13] We've tried all of this before. There
[08:15] was this alchemist named Paraselus who
[08:17] was working at the tail end of the
[08:19] Middle Ages into what we would now call
[08:21] the Renaissance. He had this crazy idea
[08:23] that life didn't actually require a womb
[08:26] and with the right ingredients and a
[08:27] controlled environment you could
[08:29] theoretically create a human or maybe
[08:32] even something better than a human. In
[08:34] his seinal work deurram
[08:37] paracela says that human semen is the
[08:40] primary seed which makes sense.
[08:41] According to his theory if you sealed it
[08:43] up in a cucurbit which was a glass
[08:45] vessel and buried it in horse dung for
[08:47] 40 days something miraculous would
[08:49] happen. Of course, the warm dung would
[08:52] provide a steady, gentle heat that
[08:54] mimicked the warmth of a womb. It makes
[08:56] total sense. After 40 days, a
[08:58] transparent human-like form would start
[09:00] to emerge. It would then have to be fed
[09:02] on human blood for 40 weeks to reach
[09:04] maturity. The goal for the alchemists
[09:06] wasn't just curiosity or trying
[09:07] different things in some early form of
[09:10] the modern scientific method. They
[09:11] wanted sovereignty over nature. For our
[09:14] AI overlords, sovereignty over
[09:16] information apparently isn't enough.
[09:18] They want the power to create and edit
[09:20] human life. Quickly back to Paracelis
[09:22] for a second. Don't you wonder what kind
[09:24] of personality would come up with an
[09:26] idea like this? Well, he was known for
[09:28] outbursts of swearing. He loved to throw
[09:30] temper tantrums and insult everyone
[09:32] around him. One of his close companions
[09:34] wrote of him, "The two years I passed in
[09:37] his company, he spent in drinking and
[09:39] gluttony day and night. He could not be
[09:41] found sober an hour or two together." I
[09:43] mean, that is kind of relatable, but
[09:45] still. This was the man who was trying
[09:47] to unlock the secrets of the universe
[09:49] and attain ultimate power. Obviously,
[09:51] Paraselus never achieved his goal of
[09:53] creating human life, but he was a major
[09:56] pioneer in the field of what we now know
[09:58] as toxicology. And he was clearly a
[10:00] tortured genius. I guess in some ways
[10:02] you could say he shot for the moon. He
[10:04] missed, but he landed in the stars.
[10:06] Let's come back to the present day and
[10:08] take a look at what the AI guys are
[10:10] saying. Sam Alman claimed in an
[10:12] interview that AGI or artificial general
[10:14] intelligence will be the most
[10:16] significant technological development in
[10:18] human history. According to Altman, it
[10:20] has the potential to solve every problem
[10:22] we face. That sure does sound a lot like
[10:24] what the Islamic alchemist Jabir Iban
[10:26] Hayam said about the philosopher stone.
[10:28] He claimed it could bring perfect health
[10:31] and rejuvenation to a decayed world. So
[10:33] Altman is saying here that he views AGI
[10:36] as a singular universal fix for the
[10:38] human condition. But I think we all know
[10:41] that reality is always more complicated
[10:43] than that. Deis Hassabis, the co-founder
[10:45] of Deep Mind, has said similar things.
[10:48] And his stated two-step mission is to
[10:51] solve intelligence and then use that to
[10:53] solve everything else. Why does that
[10:55] sound so familiar, too? Oh, that's
[10:57] right. Because the 13th century English
[10:59] philosopher and alchemist Roger Bacon
[11:01] said the same thing 800 years ago. He
[11:03] was seeking something called cientia
[11:05] integralis, a universal science that
[11:07] linked the material world to the soul.
[11:09] Just like Roger, Demisabis is
[11:12] essentially looking for the single
[11:13] source code of reality, the key to open
[11:15] up every lock. Let's go back to Altman
[11:18] for a second because I think for most of
[11:19] us, he's the face of this whole AI
[11:21] movement. He repeats this one phrase all
[11:24] the time, which is that AGI will be a
[11:27] breaking point in history. As I was
[11:29] researching this video, that kept
[11:30] standing out to me. Breaking point.
[11:32] Breaking point. breaking point. I then
[11:34] of course realized that Altman was just
[11:36] repeating a medieval concept. Have you
[11:38] ever heard of the three Hermes, also
[11:40] known as the Hermes Trisma?
[11:42] No. All right, let me fill you in.
[11:45] Medieval Latin culture, especially
[11:47] starting in the 12th century, adopted a
[11:49] specific legend to explain how highlevel
[11:52] knowledge survived the major disasters
[11:54] of history. So, if the entire world was
[11:57] flooded during the Noah's Arc story in
[11:58] the Bible, how did humans rebuild? To
[12:01] answer this burning question, medieval
[12:03] thinkers came up with a sacred genealogy
[12:06] of three main characters who were each
[12:09] appointed by God to basically protect
[12:11] and restore the secrets of nature. The
[12:13] first was Enoch who was there before the
[12:15] great flood. He was carried off to
[12:16] heaven and he was the first to get this
[12:18] divine wisdom. Then there was of course
[12:20] Noah who was saved by God during the
[12:22] flood. He was thought of in the medieval
[12:24] mind as a kind of bridge figure. So he's
[12:27] carrying the seeds of knowledge through
[12:29] all of the destruction. Then we come to
[12:31] Mercurious in post flood Egypt and he's
[12:33] the greatest of them all. He's a king
[12:35] and a philosopher and a prophet who
[12:37] formerly creates the liberal and
[12:39] mechanical arts which of course includes
[12:41] alchemy. So to sum it all up in the
[12:43] medieval view, the great flood of the
[12:46] Noah's arc story was this
[12:47] hugeformational reset that left humanity
[12:50] in a darkened state that they had to be
[12:52] recovered from. Just like Mercurius is
[12:55] the final figure who comes to restore
[12:57] knowledge after this global disaster,
[12:59] these guys like Sam Alman seem to think
[13:01] of themselves and AGI generally as this
[13:03] tool that's going to restore human
[13:05] potential after this flood of chaotic
[13:07] data that's been released on us and has
[13:09] been beating us over the head since the
[13:11] advent of the internet. This is the
[13:13] missing piece, the philosopher stone
[13:15] that we need to ascend to the next level
[13:16] of humanity. We can really go down the
[13:18] rabbit hole here. And the modern
[13:20] medievalist Michela Pereira talks a lot
[13:23] about how alchemists really made sure to
[13:25] distinguish themselves from both just
[13:27] being theory guys or just being
[13:29] craftsmen who got their hands dirty.
[13:31] They considered themselves this unique
[13:33] class of philosophers who thought with
[13:35] their hands. The most radical idea that
[13:37] the alchemists had, of course, was that
[13:39] you could be God. You could break a
[13:41] substance and reduce it to its formless
[13:43] state before giving it its ultimate
[13:45] perfect form. This is literally exactly
[13:47] how large language models are built.
[13:49] They take the base matter of human
[13:51] culture and knowledge, so basically
[13:53] entire internet, break it down into this
[13:55] mathematical soup, and then reform it
[13:57] into a perfected AGI that can speak
[14:00] every language and solve every problem.
[14:01] Even before the rise of AI in the 2020s,
[14:04] it's been obvious for a long time that
[14:06] tech bros like Elon Musk and Mark
[14:09] Zuckerberg and Peter Teal actually have
[14:11] a weirdly negative view of humanity,
[14:13] which is horrifying because they hold so
[14:16] much influence over us and we're
[14:18] humanity. If you listen to the new AI
[14:20] pioneers like Alexander Wang, who was on
[14:22] Theo Vaughn show about a year ago, their
[14:25] whole attitude is basically that humans
[14:27] are corruptible and imperfect. It's
[14:29] really hard to increase shareholder
[14:31] value when you need to eat and poop and
[14:33] sleep. But with AI, now there's an
[14:36] opportunity. AI is infinitely scalable
[14:38] and it doesn't need to sleep or poop. So
[14:40] now, of course, this is turning into a
[14:42] crazy power grab and a massive AI bubble
[14:45] where these companies are trying to
[14:47] replace flawed human labor and
[14:49] decision-making with the perfection of
[14:51] artificial intelligence. I mentioned
[14:53] tech bros, and they really do have a lot
[14:55] in common with medieval alchemists.
[14:56] Plus, I think it's important that we
[14:58] understand the personalities of the
[14:59] puppet masters who pull the strings of
[15:01] our digital world. Before we do that,
[15:03] super quick. I've got a Patreon link in
[15:05] the description below if you want to be
[15:07] part of the Medieval Mindset book club,
[15:09] get access to the podcast and video
[15:11] scripts and the Medieval Mindset reading
[15:13] list and special content that doesn't
[15:15] get posted on my main channel, as well
[15:17] as a special shout out at the end of
[15:19] every single one of my videos. Go sign
[15:20] up today. Anyway, I've talked a lot
[15:22] about Sam Alman, but what about Jensen
[15:24] Hang, the Nvidia guy? Boy, he sure does
[15:27] remind me of Elaine Deil, the 12th
[15:29] century French polymath. A polymath is a
[15:32] person of wide-ranging knowledge or
[15:34] learning across different fields. And
[15:36] polymath is the medieval mindset word of
[15:39] the week. So try to weave that into some
[15:41] conversations over the next few days.
[15:43] Ela Deo was another medieval genius and
[15:45] he wrote this masterpiece called the
[15:47] anti-Cladianis. It's a poem and in the
[15:50] poem, nature looks at the world and sees
[15:52] that it's corrupted by vice. She decides
[15:54] that the only way to save humanity is to
[15:57] create a new kind of man who is
[15:59] physically, intellectually, and morally
[16:01] perfect. Maybe you think you know where
[16:03] this is going because you read
[16:04] Frankenstein. But I assure you, you're
[16:06] wrong. Just like you or I would do,
[16:07] nature gathers the seven liberal arts,
[16:09] grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic,
[16:11] geometry, music, and astronomy to build
[16:14] a chariot that can travel to the
[16:16] heavens. Then along comes prudence. Now,
[16:18] it's worth mentioning that like most
[16:20] medieval writing, this is an allegorical
[16:22] poem and these sort of intangible ideas
[16:25] like nature and prudence are depicted as
[16:27] living beings. Anyway, Prudence takes
[16:29] the chariot and drives it all through
[16:31] the celestial spheres. Along the way,
[16:33] she encounters the limits of human
[16:35] reason and has to be helped by faith and
[16:37] theology to finally reach the throne of
[16:40] God. But wait, we in the present day
[16:42] have reached the limits of human reason.
[16:44] But instead of using faith and theology
[16:46] to ascend to divinity, we're using
[16:48] algorithmic models that nobody really
[16:50] understands. Interesting. In the end of
[16:53] Deil's poem, God grants a soul to the
[16:55] new man, and nature crafts a body for
[16:58] it. It all wraps up in this big boss
[17:00] fight where the new man and the virtues
[17:02] fight against and defeat the vices,
[17:05] which are greed and luxury and pride and
[17:07] so on and so forth. Now, this poem isn't
[17:10] about alchemy in the turning lead into
[17:12] gold sense, but it's actually super
[17:14] alchemical in its philosophy. Alchemists
[17:17] obviously wanted to purge metal to find
[17:19] the gold within. And in the poem, nature
[17:21] purges the elements to create the body
[17:23] of the new man. It all ties into this
[17:25] idea that as humans, we carry an
[17:27] inherent imperfection within us. But
[17:29] there's something out there, something
[17:31] that we have the power to discover that
[17:33] would somehow do away with that
[17:34] imperfection and allow us to step into a
[17:37] new ascended life. At this point, I'm
[17:39] sure you're probably wondering what
[17:40] literally any of this could have to do
[17:42] with Jensen Huang. Well, in the poem, De
[17:44] Leo focuses really specifically on the
[17:47] physical requirements and ingredients
[17:49] that would be needed to create this new
[17:51] man. He's locked in on the material
[17:53] structure of perfection. That's Huang in
[17:55] a nutshell. When you look at all of the
[17:57] top AI guys, he's the one who's the
[17:59] architect of the material. There's those
[18:01] like Altman who give these prophecies
[18:03] about how AI is going to save the world
[18:05] and cure cancer, blah blah blah. Huang
[18:07] isn't as concerned with that. He's
[18:09] concerned about the physical hardware.
[18:11] Let me frame this in alchemist's term
[18:13] first so we know what we're talking
[18:14] about. For medieval alchemists, the
[18:16] athanor, a word derived from the Arabic
[18:18] alanor, which means oven or furnace, was
[18:21] the most important piece of equipment
[18:23] you could have. It was designed to
[18:25] maintain a steady, unfluctuating
[18:27] temperature for weeks or even months
[18:29] without the alchemist having to stay
[18:30] awake to tend the fire. You see, when
[18:33] these guys were trying to turn lead into
[18:35] gold, they weren't just blasting
[18:36] everything with fire. They actually
[18:38] believed in this really specific
[18:40] progression of temperature that was
[18:42] supposed to mirror the growth of a
[18:43] child. Exactly what Paraselis was trying
[18:45] to do with the horse tongue. Heat grade
[18:47] one was a gentle warmth called the heat
[18:49] of a human. Then there was heat grade
[18:52] two, the heat of a setting hen, which
[18:53] was a little hotter to encourage the
[18:55] quickening of matter. Next, they would
[18:57] crank things a bit higher to grade
[18:59] three, the heat of calcination, which
[19:02] was a stronger fire to strip away
[19:04] impurities. Finally, they would max out
[19:06] at heat grade four, which was the
[19:08] melting fire. This was the most intense
[19:10] heat that was used for the final
[19:12] transmutation into gold. Jensen Hong and
[19:15] his boys at NVIDIA are really concerned
[19:17] with heat, too. Because if you want to
[19:19] turn AI technology into something usable
[19:21] and profitable, the physical conditions
[19:24] have to be just right. The data centers
[19:26] that Hang supplies are all about thermal
[19:28] management. The chips are liquid cooled
[19:30] because the heat to compute is so
[19:32] intense that it could actually destroy
[19:35] the hardware that generates it. This is
[19:36] where all the controversy about AI's
[19:38] water usage comes in. I'm sure you've
[19:40] seen this on social media. These data
[19:42] centers are a huge drain on the local
[19:45] energy grids of the areas they occupy
[19:47] because they need an uninterrupted power
[19:49] supply to keep the hardware running
[19:51] 24/7. So the alchemist belief that
[19:53] intensity plus time equals
[19:55] transformation is actually becoming a
[19:58] reality. If you throw enough energy at a
[20:00] large enough data set for a long enough
[20:02] time, intelligence starts to emerge from
[20:04] the noise. That's the gold being
[20:06] transformed from the lead of all of
[20:08] ourformational randomness on the
[20:10] internet. So, let's land the plane here.
[20:11] I think we're all a little scared of AI,
[20:13] and rightfully so. It's been forced into
[20:16] literally everything against our will,
[20:18] and it feels like nobody truly
[20:19] understands what it's capable of. But
[20:21] it's worth mentioning that people in the
[20:23] Middle Ages were terrified of alchemy,
[20:25] too. They said it was witchcraft, and
[20:27] clergymen were constantly calling out
[20:28] for being satanic. These alchemists
[20:30] claim they could cure all diseases and
[20:32] create immortal beings and turn lead
[20:34] into gold, but they never actually
[20:37] achieved any of the insane stuff they
[20:39] said they would. However, all of their
[20:42] experimentation laid the groundwork for
[20:44] the modern fields of chemistry and
[20:46] biology and medical science. Maybe AI
[20:49] won't cure cancer or bring about world
[20:51] peace, but it might have some other
[20:53] downstream effects that could actually
[20:55] be pretty helpful in the long run. For
[20:56] now, you should definitely subscribe to
[20:58] your favorite YouTube alchemist if you
[21:00] haven't already, which is me, because
[21:02] I'm here turning these ridiculous
[21:04] historical comparisons into pure gold.
[21:07] And I want to know, what do you think?
[21:09] Are we right to be afraid of AI, or
[21:11] should we welcome our new overlords with
[21:13] open arms? Let me know in the comments.
[21:16] As always, I'm John. This has been
[21:18] Medieval Mindset. And remember, the past
[21:20] isn't gone, it's simply waiting to be
[21:23] rediscovered.
