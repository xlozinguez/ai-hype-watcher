[00:00] I think Cloud Co-Work is the next
[00:01] evolution of how we use L&amp;Ms, and I
[00:03] think we'll see massive adoption in
[00:04] 2026. With Co-work, Cloud can now take
[00:07] actions on folders on your computer,
[00:09] connect to your entire software stack,
[00:11] and start doing day-to-day tasks for
[00:12] you. So, in this video, I'll show you
[00:14] how to set it up, how it compares to
[00:16] Claude and Cloud Code, and how to use it
[00:18] like a pro with Cloud Skills, which I
[00:20] think will replace a lot of your
[00:21] projects, custom GPTs, or even some of
[00:23] your NAN or automation workflows. I've
[00:26] been using cloud co-work daily for the
[00:27] last week and it's already changing how
[00:29] I work. Now before showing you a demo,
[00:30] what actually is co-work and how is it
[00:32] different from cloud and cloud code? Now
[00:34] cloud and L&amp;M's of course were mostly
[00:36] still chat limited. Now most people know
[00:38] co-work for being able to take actions
[00:39] on folders on your computer, being able
[00:41] to connect it to your software stack,
[00:42] but I think the biggest game changer is
[00:44] being able to build and use skills in
[00:46] co-work. Now many people have been using
[00:48] and building skills up until now through
[00:50] cloud code, but co-work makes this much
[00:52] more accessible to everyone. I'll
[00:53] explain in a sec how skills work and
[00:55] show you some demos and how to set them
[00:56] up. Um, but it also seems like cloud
[00:58] co-work has much more of a planning
[01:00] capability just like uh cloud code has.
[01:02] So I think in the end we'll see more and
[01:04] more adoption of co-work for day-to-day
[01:06] office work or tasks as it will likely
[01:08] have a superior interface for these
[01:10] types of tasks and cloud code more for
[01:12] building production ready applications
[01:14] and cloud for more brainstorming and
[01:16] question and answer use cases. So in
[01:18] this video I'll first cover how uh file
[01:20] accessing and organizing works then
[01:21] connectors MCP and browser use then what
[01:24] I think is the most powerful cloud
[01:26] skills and use cases and how to set them
[01:27] up and lastly how do you do code
[01:29] execution within cloud co-work all right
[01:31] so what do you need to get started with
[01:32] co-work first you need a cloud pro team
[01:34] or enterprise subscription it's not
[01:36] available on the free tier yet and
[01:38] second you need a cloud desktop app
[01:39] co-work doesn't run in the browser yet
[01:41] so it's desktop only so if you're on a
[01:43] paid plan and you have updated your
[01:45] cloud desktop app you should have
[01:47] co-work available here in the second tab
[01:48] next to clot code which I'm not going to
[01:50] cover in this video. Now feature most
[01:52] people have been talking about which is
[01:54] cool but I don't think is the biggest
[01:55] feature of co-work is file accessing or
[01:57] organizing. So as you can see here I can
[01:59] basically give it access here to a file
[02:01] on my computer for example downloads and
[02:04] now cloth can take actions and read the
[02:06] files in this folder. For example I can
[02:09] ask it to organize my download folder.
[02:11] Claude can you help me organize my
[02:13] downloads folder?
[02:15] So you can see it start asking me some
[02:17] questions first. And this is sort of
[02:18] that planning capability that comes from
[02:20] cloth code which I really like. So how
[02:22] would you like me to organize your files
[02:24] uh let's say by file type.
[02:27] So you can see here's what I found in
[02:29] the folder you selected images documents
[02:31] videos and now it's creating organized
[02:33] uh folder structure and putting
[02:34] everything in the right folders. And you
[02:37] can see it sort of makes this plan here
[02:39] and goes through the entire plan step by
[02:41] step. So, it's now organized my download
[02:43] folder
[02:46] as you can see. So, quite a useful
[02:49] feature, especially if you're
[02:50] unorganized like I am. Now, of course,
[02:52] you can also use this for many more use
[02:53] cases. For example, you can have folders
[02:55] where you give Claude context on your
[02:57] business, your ICP, your tone of voice.
[02:59] So, when you're writing something new,
[03:00] you can just ask Claude to go through
[03:02] your specific context without having
[03:04] that uh all saved into separate
[03:06] projects. And this becomes especially
[03:08] powerful with skills, which I'll get to
[03:09] in a second. But first, let's cover
[03:11] connections quickly. So, first we have
[03:13] built-in connections from cloud. So, if
[03:15] we go here to uh settings in cloud and
[03:18] you go to connectors, you'll see all the
[03:19] built-in connectors from uh from cloud.
[03:22] So, we can just choose one, connect it,
[03:24] and then we can automatically start
[03:26] taking action and getting data from all
[03:28] of these softwares. Now, if your
[03:30] software is not listed here, you can uh
[03:32] also add your MCPS, right? That's the
[03:34] way it connects it to the softwares uh
[03:37] uh manually. So you can go here to the
[03:39] developer section. Generally you can
[03:41] just type in Google for example for your
[03:44] specific software. Let's say web flow
[03:45] where my website's built. I can go MCP
[03:49] cloud right and if it's available it
[03:51] will pop up in the documentation and
[03:53] it'll usually give you an instruction on
[03:55] how to set it up. So in this case I can
[03:58] go here and it says cloud desktop and it
[04:00] will give me the step by step on how to
[04:03] connect my MCP manually with cloud code.
[04:07] So, I've already done that here in the
[04:08] developer section. Basically, what you
[04:10] do is you open the clock desktop
[04:11] config.json
[04:13] and then you add whatever is here in the
[04:17] JSON. You just add that in a file
[04:20] editor, whatever it is. In my case, it's
[04:22] an ID. You paste that in. You save the
[04:25] file and then you have the MCP
[04:26] connected. So, that that's how you can
[04:28] do it manually. Now, if the software you
[04:30] want to connect doesn't have a specific
[04:31] MCP server yet, there are two other
[04:33] options. The first one is setting it up
[04:35] manually through NAND. So in NAD we can
[04:38] set up our own MCP servers and then
[04:40] connect it to all the different API
[04:42] calls or actions we want to take in the
[04:44] software. So for example here I have a
[04:45] UniLow LinkedIn server so I can send
[04:48] messages on LinkedIn and then we connect
[04:50] this MCP from NAN to claude in order to
[04:53] take those actions. Now I have a full
[04:55] video which I'll make sure to link uh
[04:56] below too on how to set this up. I'll
[04:58] not cover it in this video. And then the
[05:00] last option you have is to use cloud
[05:02] browser use. So instead of actually
[05:04] connecting it through APIs and MCPS, we
[05:07] actually just let it use our browser to
[05:09] access the software. Now how do we use
[05:11] these connections? We can just tell
[05:12] Claude, right? So we can say, can you
[05:14] check what ideas I have in my notion
[05:17] YouTube tutorial pipeline.
[05:21] You can see it got the ideas for my
[05:23] notion pipeline and and I can now of
[05:26] course start working on the ideas
[05:27] together with cloud and then update it
[05:30] directly into notion. And then for
[05:32] browser use, we can either ask it to use
[05:34] the browser or generally if we ask it to
[05:36] access a software it doesn't have a
[05:38] connection with yet, it generally
[05:39] triggers the browser automatically. So,
[05:42] uh we can say something like do research
[05:44] on X on cloud co-work use cases.
[05:52] So, you can see it's automatically
[05:54] starting to use my browser. And the nice
[05:56] thing is in co-work is that we can also
[05:58] have this running in the background
[06:00] while we're working inside of a new
[06:01] task. So we can work on you know
[06:04] multiple tasks at the same time and have
[06:05] these browsers running in the
[06:06] background. So you can see it starts
[06:07] looking for cloth co-work. So now it
[06:10] starts scrolling through and looking for
[06:12] potential use cases. So it's now listed
[06:15] out use cases SEO automation document
[06:18] and data processing knowledge management
[06:20] etc etc. Now all cool features but you
[06:22] might have seen this before already. I
[06:24] think the real power is using these
[06:26] features together inside of skills. So
[06:28] what are skills? Now I see skills as the
[06:30] next evolution of projects or custom
[06:32] GPTs or system prompts. Skills basically
[06:34] save a specific instruction or process
[06:37] and knowledge sources to best execute a
[06:40] specific task or workflow. You can see
[06:42] it sort of like a system prompt, but the
[06:44] difference is you can now trigger
[06:45] multiple of these skills in the same
[06:47] context window or task. So, we can
[06:49] combine these skills to give Clot a lot
[06:51] more context on how to execute specific
[06:53] workflows. For example, I can have one
[06:55] skill helping me go through the process
[06:57] of packaging a YouTube video idea into a
[06:59] good title and thumbnail concept with
[07:01] specific knowledge sources like an
[07:03] outlier database, instructions for how
[07:05] to write good titles, and the process to
[07:07] get to one. And then a second skill
[07:09] could be uh on writing a good intro with
[07:11] specific knowledge sources, examples,
[07:13] and instructions on how to write a good
[07:15] intro. And I can use all of these skills
[07:17] in the same context window instead of
[07:19] jumping between different projects or
[07:21] system prompts all the time. And it only
[07:23] uses these knowledge sources and
[07:24] instruction when the scale is triggered.
[07:26] So we don't overload the context window
[07:28] with too much information. We only use
[07:30] it when necessary. And also because we
[07:32] can now easily connect cloudco work to
[07:33] our softwares. We can add in the
[07:35] instructions when to update or access
[07:37] data from external softwares. for
[07:39] example, updating my notion pipeline or
[07:41] YouTube pipeline automatically after the
[07:43] title is decided and the intro is
[07:45] written. So, we can actually start
[07:46] automating workflows in a sort of
[07:48] repeatable way. It becomes much more
[07:50] reliable. And I think this is a superior
[07:52] setup over projects or custom GPTs or
[07:55] even over some NAD or automation
[07:57] workflows. Now, why is that? Because if
[07:59] you think about it, for many day-to-day
[08:00] jobs and tasks, we actually need a lot
[08:02] of human in a loop. Many tasks are very
[08:05] context dependent, are iterative, and
[08:07] require a lot of that human in a loop.
[08:09] For example, like if you create social
[08:11] media content, YouTube videos, creating
[08:13] presentations, etc. And having a fully
[08:15] automated workflow on naden or make.com
[08:18] can become a little bit rigid for these
[08:19] types of workflows or require you to hop
[08:21] between different interfaces all the
[08:23] time. And on the other hand, of course,
[08:25] with L&amp;Ms, we have to give it the
[08:27] context around you, the process, the
[08:29] tools and knowledge each time you want
[08:32] to do this process again. So I think
[08:34] skills can be a great way to automate
[08:35] some of these iterative context
[08:37] dependent tasks that do follow specific
[08:40] context and a specific process. So how
[08:42] do we use these skills? First of all, we
[08:44] have the built-in skills from cloud
[08:45] co-work. Second, we can use skills that
[08:47] other people have built. And lastly,
[08:49] which I think is very powerful uh
[08:50] because most people have unique
[08:52] workflows is to build your own. So I'm
[08:54] going to show you an example of each
[08:55] one. For the built-in skills, you can
[08:57] just go to uh claude, go to the settings
[08:59] again, go to capabilities. If you scroll
[09:02] all the way down, you'll have a tab here
[09:03] which says example skills. And here are
[09:05] basically the skills that are built in
[09:07] from Claude. So we can see we have
[09:08] Convas design uh MCP builder skills
[09:11] creator that actually allows us to build
[09:13] skills ourselves. Uh and the way to
[09:16] trigger this is by just telling Claude
[09:17] that you want to use a specific skill,
[09:19] right? So for example here, please load
[09:21] the Canva scale. I spelled it wrong, but
[09:23] it understood and it loaded the scale.
[09:25] So you can see it's running the scale
[09:26] and based on the instructions of the
[09:28] scale, it started asking me some
[09:30] questions based on the instructions also
[09:32] created a plan. It went through that
[09:34] plan and in the end created a website
[09:36] banner for uh my website. So these are
[09:38] pre-built instructions that are embedded
[09:40] into the skill on how to execute a
[09:42] specific workflow. Now the built-in
[09:44] skills from cloud are pretty limited and
[09:46] there are some really good skills being
[09:47] built by other people. So highly
[09:49] recommend checking out some of these
[09:51] marketplaces. There are three main ones
[09:53] that I found. The first one is
[09:54] smithy.ai. AI/Skills. You can see we
[09:56] have 14,500 uh skills that other people
[09:59] have built. So, hook development here,
[10:02] um web app testing, uh Excel analysis,
[10:05] anything you can imagine people have
[10:06] built skills for. And some of these are
[10:08] really good. So, highly recommend
[10:09] checking them out. Um another one is
[10:11] skillhub.com, right? Again, have
[10:13] thousands of of skills. And the third
[10:15] one here is skillsmpp.com.
[10:18] So, for example, here we have paid ads,
[10:21] right? Ad copy generator. Now, how do
[10:23] you use these skills yourself? You
[10:25] basically go here and you download the
[10:26] zip file, right? You save that. Then you
[10:30] go back to cloth code. You go back to
[10:32] the settings to the capabilities. And if
[10:34] you scroll down, you'll have here an
[10:36] option of add.
[10:38] We then get three options, right? We can
[10:40] create it with cloth, build it
[10:41] ourselves, or upload a skill. I'm going
[10:43] to show you the other ones in a second,
[10:44] but in this case, we're going to upload
[10:45] it. So, we just upload this the zip
[10:48] file,
[10:49] and now we have the skill uploaded. If I
[10:51] now go to a new task and I say for
[10:53] example um I want to write some uh meta
[10:57] ad. Can you use the skill to write these
[10:59] ads?
[11:01] Now of course the skill doesn't have any
[11:02] context on me. So I'll give it a little
[11:04] bit more context on my business by just
[11:06] adding another file uh around my
[11:08] business.
[11:10] For example, I can give it access to my
[11:12] ICP
[11:14] uh my voice personality and what we do.
[11:20] I added some context around me and my
[11:25] So you can see I invoke the ad copy
[11:27] generator skill and read your business
[11:29] context. So it is invoked the skill
[11:33] and these instructions on what questions
[11:35] to ask already embedded into that skill.
[11:37] So in this case what's the primary goal
[11:39] of the meta ads? Let's say lead
[11:40] generation. Uh what audience
[11:44] uh let's say freelancers solrepreneurs.
[11:46] How many ad variations? Let's say five.
[11:48] what offer
[11:50] um let's say paid program enrollment. So
[11:53] you can see this progress again is
[11:55] loaded from the scale right the plan of
[11:57] what it should do.
[11:59] So now it's created meta ad variations
[12:02] as you can see this is pretty
[12:03] comprehensive. We have five variations
[12:04] here directly in a word document uh with
[12:07] the primary text, full primary text,
[12:09] headline, description and CTA. And all
[12:11] of these instructions of creating this
[12:13] word document to create copies for all
[12:15] these specific things in meta ads are of
[12:18] course out of the specific scale. Now,
[12:20] of course, I could could have given it a
[12:21] bit more context around my business. It
[12:23] would probably result in better ads, but
[12:25] this is pretty impressive as you can
[12:26] see. And what I can do right now, which
[12:28] gets me to the third point of building
[12:30] your own skills, is for example, adapt
[12:33] this original skill together with some
[12:35] of my context knowledge sources and
[12:37] create my own skill. So I can literally
[12:39] just tell Claude,
[12:41] use this skill combined with my specific
[12:44] knowledge sources to create a new skill
[12:47] that helps me create ads.
[12:50] So you can see now it's created an
[12:52] entirely new skill based on the other
[12:54] skill together with my specific context.
[12:57] Now the second way to create your own
[12:58] skills which I think is the most
[12:59] powerful and I highly recommend
[13:00] exploring because this will really
[13:02] change the way you work. So what we're
[13:04] doing is we're basically walking through
[13:05] one of your tasks your daily tasks or
[13:07] processes uh together with Claude once
[13:10] manually and after you've done it
[13:11] manually you save it as a skill so next
[13:13] time you can repeat it. So for in this
[13:15] case for example I'm repurposing one of
[13:17] my latest YouTube videos into a
[13:18] newsletter. Now generally what I do is I
[13:21] uh use a YouTube transcription tool on
[13:23] the internet to get my transcript and
[13:25] then based on that I go through the
[13:26] process of writing my newsletter which
[13:27] is first writing the subject line the
[13:29] hook and then the newsletter. So I just
[13:31] go through the entire process one by one
[13:33] with claude once. So for example here I
[13:34] said first step I want you to do is use
[13:36] this you YouTube link to go to the page
[13:39] below to download the entire YouTube
[13:40] transcript so you have context on what
[13:42] this video is about. Uh so basically I
[13:44] shared it a link where I can download
[13:45] the YouTube transcript. Now, in reality,
[13:47] you can probably better do this with an
[13:48] MCP or uh API, but I just want to show
[13:50] you this because you can literally
[13:51] instruct it to go to any website that
[13:53] doesn't have an MCP or anything yet and
[13:55] just tell it what to do, which can then
[13:56] be saved later and can then be
[13:58] replicated for anytime in the future you
[14:00] want to do this same task again. It took
[14:02] my YouTube link, went to the website
[14:04] together with a cloud browser, and it
[14:06] downloaded the entire YouTube transcript
[14:08] as you can see here. Then it saved that
[14:10] in a file. Then I shared it another
[14:11] prompt. I'm going to repurpose this for
[14:13] my newsletter. I've given you access to
[14:14] context around my business, my CP, my
[14:16] voice personality, my newsletter
[14:18] strategy, and newsletter examples. Based
[14:19] on all of these, I want you to write a
[14:21] newsletter according to my exact tone of
[14:22] voice, almost mimicking uh my tone of
[14:25] voice from the examples. I don't want
[14:26] you to write a newsletter straight away.
[14:28] We're going to do this uh step by step.
[14:29] I first want you to give suggestions on
[14:32] potential subject lines. You give me
[14:33] five to 10 suggestions and then the
[14:35] second step is to find a hook. Once we
[14:37] have that locked in, we write the actual
[14:38] newsletter. This is generally how I like
[14:40] to work with L&amp;Ms. wanted my L&amp;M to give
[14:42] me suggestions instead of coming with
[14:44] oneoff um ideas and I go through the
[14:47] process step by step by picking
[14:48] suggestions or changing suggestions
[14:50] slightly. Now in this case I had all
[14:52] these documents already or what we do my
[14:54] ICP my voice personality newsletter
[14:56] strategy and newsletter examples but of
[14:58] course you can also walk through this
[14:59] manually once together with claude and
[15:01] once you create the scale it will create
[15:03] these files automatically so the next
[15:04] times you don't have to redo this again.
[15:06] So based on that it started it gave me
[15:08] subject line options I chose the one I
[15:10] like most then hook options I chose the
[15:12] one I like most and then write wrote the
[15:14] full newsletter. Now normally I would
[15:16] make this process a little bit longer
[15:17] but it's just for the example here. And
[15:19] then at the end I just asked it to
[15:20] create a skill out of this process. I
[15:22] save that and now if I do this task
[15:24] again and share a YouTube link and say
[15:27] let's repurpose this YouTube link for a
[15:29] newsletter
[15:31] it will start following this exact
[15:33] process that we've done before. So you
[15:36] can see it loaded the skill. So now it
[15:38] already knows what to do. It will first
[15:39] have to go to that tool to download the
[15:41] YouTube transcript.
[15:43] So you can see it's using the browser to
[15:44] do this.
[15:46] So now it's gotten the transcript and
[15:48] now you can see it's already doing the
[15:50] next step which is reading my uh voice
[15:53] guide, my newsletter patterns, right?
[15:55] And you can see it follows that same
[15:57] process that I instructed it before
[15:58] which is first it gives me subject line
[16:00] options. All right, let's say two.
[16:04] Then it gives me hook options.
[16:07] Let's say number two.
[16:10] And now it's writing the entire
[16:11] newsletter in my tone of voice. If you
[16:13] know my style, you can see that it's
[16:15] following it. Now anyway, the point of
[16:18] all of this, you can basically start
[16:19] automating any task you do on a
[16:21] day-to-day basis across any software
[16:23] you're using uh just by creating a scale
[16:25] out of it. So I think this is going to
[16:27] be really powerful and it's really going
[16:28] to change the way we work because if you
[16:31] think about it for many tasks we do on a
[16:32] day-to-day basis having claude as your
[16:34] main interface can be far superior first
[16:37] of all because it can execute but also
[16:39] because you can uh iterate and improve
[16:41] your workflows and what you're doing
[16:43] together with an L&amp;M like claude and
[16:45] then another way to create skills fast
[16:47] which I've been using a lot is to create
[16:48] them out of your old uh cloud project or
[16:51] chatbt custom GPTs etc. I used to have a
[16:54] lot of uh these custom projects for
[16:55] example for my YouTube packaging uh
[16:57] which have a system prompt on
[16:59] specifically how to do this process of
[17:01] you know from a video idea get to
[17:03] YouTube titles and potential YouTube
[17:04] thumbnail and the these also have
[17:07] specific guides and knowledge sources
[17:09] like a YouTube outlier sheet etc. Right?
[17:12] So basically what I do is I um copy and
[17:15] paste that system prompt and I add some
[17:18] of those knowledge sources for that
[17:19] specific uh project and then I ask clot
[17:22] to create a scale out of it. So hey
[17:23] Claude, can you help me um create a
[17:26] scale
[17:27] um that helps me with my YouTube
[17:29] packaging? Now this scale is going to be
[17:32] based on uh previous project I used. I'm
[17:36] going to share the system prompt from
[17:38] the previous project so you understand
[17:39] how this process should be executed in
[17:42] the skill and I'm going to share you all
[17:45] the knowledge sources that should be
[17:47] used when executing this process.
[17:52] So I just give it the system prompt
[17:55] and I'll share the specific
[17:58] um knowledge sources that I want. So in
[18:00] this case, my community ICP, maybe my
[18:04] personal background, uh a title bank,
[18:06] and a YouTube outlier sheet. So I can
[18:10] give that all and then just let Claude
[18:13] build a skill out of this. And in my
[18:15] experience, this has been really
[18:16] efficient because now I've built a lot
[18:19] of these skills out of my old projects
[18:21] and now I can just use these skills
[18:23] inside of the same context window. So I
[18:25] don't have to hop between different
[18:26] projects all the time. So now created
[18:28] the entire skill. I can just click here
[18:30] on the skill and opening cloud. And then
[18:32] you see that it created the skill MD and
[18:35] reference files, right? We can add that
[18:38] to the library.
[18:40] And now we have the skills inside the
[18:42] skill inside of our library. And now we
[18:44] can just try it out.
[18:46] Uh, can you use the YouTube packaging
[18:49] skill to help me ideate on my new title
[18:51] and thumbnail for my new video?
[18:55] You can see it's now loaded the skill.
[18:58] It's reading all the files
[19:01] and this is exactly the instructions for
[19:03] my system prompt. I don't want it to
[19:04] suggest ideas right away, right? To help
[19:07] you get what's the core idea inside or
[19:09] topic of the video. So, I have to fill
[19:11] out and go through this step-by-step
[19:13] process before it actually puts out
[19:15] suggestions for titles and thumbnails.
[19:17] So, I'm not going to walk you through
[19:18] the entire process, but it basically
[19:20] replicated this. And it's going to use
[19:22] these knowledge sources in each of the
[19:23] phases or steps. And in my experience,
[19:26] this is working far better than true
[19:27] system prompt or project. So, highly
[19:29] recommend playing around with this and
[19:31] trying it for your own workflows because
[19:33] now I can also add in that it has to
[19:35] update, for example, my notion
[19:36] automatically at the end. I can update
[19:38] the scale whenever I want. So, I can
[19:40] make them bigger and bigger, automate
[19:42] more and more of the the workflow. I can
[19:44] combine different skills in this same
[19:46] context window. So, it can become really
[19:49] powerful. And I think a lot of our
[19:50] day-to-day work can be done a lot faster
[19:52] if we get good at building skills. Now
[19:55] one more thing I want to show you is we
[19:57] also have code execution now in cloud
[19:59] code work. Uh now this is different from
[20:01] cloud code. Think of cloud code more as
[20:03] building applications. In coowork we can
[20:05] use code to do specific tasks for us.
[20:08] For example, we can use code to
[20:09] visualize data. I can say for example um
[20:13] look at the outlier database sheet and
[20:16] create some graphs out of the data in
[20:19] there.
[20:20] So we can use it for data visualization.
[20:23] And we can we can use code for basic
[20:25] formatting of images for example inside
[20:27] of our folders um to change the aspect
[20:30] ratio and things like this. So we can do
[20:32] basic code execution to include co work.
[20:35] So it's now finished. So you can see it
[20:37] now sheet. Of course I didn't give it
[20:38] specific instruction but it does this
[20:40] through code execution. Anyway that's it
[20:42] for this video. If you want to dive a
[20:43] little bit deeper into these topics and
