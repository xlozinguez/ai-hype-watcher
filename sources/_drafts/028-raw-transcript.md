[00:00] Software developers in the US get paid around $113,000 to $200,000 per year
[00:06] with a median at around $150,000.
[00:08] While the US government actually puts the range closer to $132,000
[00:13] compared to the Stack Overflow survey, other countries like Australia, Canada,
[00:18] UK, and Germany all fall behind the US when it comes to wages for developers.
[00:23] But when we look at job postings across countries, Australia and Canada are
[00:28] actually showing stronger numbers in comparison to preandemic levels. And
[00:33] meanwhile, the tech industry overall is still recovering from the massive layoff
[00:38] that started around the end of 2022 to early 2023. And as the industry is still
[00:44] recovering, the demand shifted away from pure software developer roles to machine
[00:49] learning and data engineering roles as AI becomes more dominant. All of this
[00:54] points back to the reality that while there are 47 million developers in the
[00:58] world, more than half of the developers are in the age bracket of 18 to 34 years
[01:03] old. And that is the exact demographic for software developers that are
[01:07] suffering the most when we look at the headcount for current employment in the
[01:11] industry. Welcome to kale writes code where every second counts. Quick shout
[01:15] out to Cotlin sponsoring this video.
[01:16] More on them later. You probably have seen this chart from Indeed hiring lab
[01:21] before where it shows you an index of software developer job postings across
[01:25] time. But unfortunately there's a huge misunderstanding when it comes to this
[01:29] very chart. The chart here shows you 100 in the y-axis as a prepandemic level
[01:35] baseline anchored in February 2020. And relative to that point, we measure the
[01:41] variance at each data point adjusted with seasonality. In other words, around
[01:46] February 2022 where the index showed a value of 234, which means even in
[01:52] consideration of trailing three-year seasonality was about 134% higher than
[01:57] the baseline. Meaning here we hire 24 people as opposed to hiring 10 people
[02:03] for example. Now when we fast forward from this peak to today, the most recent
[02:08] data point shows that the US is at 69, the UK is at 63, Germany at 58, Canada
[02:15] at 78, and Australia at 122. So what we are seeing here in the US is a slow
[02:21] recovery towards the quote unquote normal baseline at 100 in comparison to
[02:27] February 2020. Now when we overlay this with major flagship models starting with
[02:32] GPT 3.5 in November 2022 that launched ChachiPT to the world GBT4 in March 2023
[02:39] and the first commercial reasoning model 01 announced in September 2024 followed
[02:45] by the Deepseek moment that happened in January 2025 along with many other
[02:50] breakthroughs like Sonnet 3.5, Opus 4, Gemini 2.5 and Gemini 3 all played a big
[02:56] part in the industry. We also have many coding agents mainly in 2025 that took
[03:02] these models to disrupt the software development industry and tools like clot
[03:06] code, open code and more recently openi codeex app really started to poke at the
[03:12] industry whether we really needed all of 47 million developers that we have
[03:17] currently in the world. So as you can see there's a bit of a tugofwar between
[03:21] where the baseline should be now that AI is changing the industry. In other
[03:26] words, is this an early sign that maybe we will never reach back to the
[03:31] prepandemic level and we now need a different baseline than February 2020?
[03:35] When we look at the Dora report, while some early adopters of AI coding go all
[03:40] the way back to 2022, a large majority of developers actually started to use AI
[03:46] coding at around 2024 and onwards, which is pretty recent. And as the underlying
[03:51] coding agents became more and more complex, there's been this K-shaped
[03:55] divergence between developers who orchestrate their work entirely using AI
[04:01] and developers who use AI merely as a tool. And leading experts in the dev
[04:05] industry like Uncle Bob started to notice how when he goes from two agents
[04:10] to three agents, he started to become the bottleneck in coding. And similar
[04:14] sentiment has been shared with Andre Karpathy where he shared how he felt
[04:18] behind as a programmer using AI coding agents. As you can see, given this lag
[04:23] in the AI adoption among developers, the K-shaped adoption between coders who
[04:28] embrace the tool and coders who say that AI only moderately automates their task.
[04:34] Now, all of this crescendos into the split between entry-level developers who
[04:39] are early in their career, who seem to be suffering the most. And with that we
[04:43] need to talk about cotlin. Intelligent idea is an environment that lets you
[04:47] build while working with whichever coding agent that fits your workflow.
[04:51] Whether it's codex app, clot code or jet brains juni. I created a very simple
[04:55] code that allows you to spin up a backend system that could read customer
[04:59] log documentation that I have here in this file. And as easy as the code
[05:03] looks, I can now use curl commands to reach the endpoint to fetch information
[05:07] contained in it. And now with their Juni AI coding agent, you can easily use it
[05:11] to continue coding by asking it to further implement my project by adding a
[05:15] new route that could access file by file. Try out Cotlin's easytouse
[05:19] back-end system and their Juni AI coding agent that helps you ship products
[05:23] faster. The common sentiment out there is that AI will take away all
[05:27] entry-level positions to start.
[05:29] Enthropic CEO Dario Amade famously said that in a few years 50% of entry-level
[05:34] white collar positions will be impacted by AI. While claims like this certainly
[05:39] needs to be analyzed more thoroughly, it does speak to at least some uncertainty
[05:43] in the industry whether companies should hire more developers, which is reflected
[05:47] here where we're still behind the prepandemic level. And looking at other
[05:51] countries like Australia and Canada, where they're nearing back to where they
[05:55] used to be or even above the level in Australia, the US still seems to be on
[05:59] the fence about how hiring should look like with AI in the mix. At the moment,
[06:04] however, machine learning engineers saw a nearly 40% jump in demand, data
[06:09] engineers seeing 10% jump, while front-end and mobile engineers actually
[06:13] shrunk more than 5% going from 2024 to 2025. And meanwhile, the pace of how
[06:20] fast AI is being used is not stopping.
[06:22] According to the semi analysis report, more than 4% of public repos in GitHub
[06:27] use clot code, which goes to show how fast AI is being adopted to those who
[06:32] actually embrace it. And this kind of acceleration will likely continue
[06:37] causing the split between 52% of developers who don't use AI agents while
[06:42] the rest are trying to learn how to best incorporate AI into workflow as fast as
[06:47] possible. I think it's worth mentioning why this K-shaped adoption is occurring
[06:52] among developers. One of the biggest components comes down to trust where a
[06:56] large majority of developers simply don't trust AI's response in their
[07:01] coding needs. But this sentiment will certainly improve as the underlying
[07:05] model gets better in time. But the biggest issue is when it comes down to
[07:09] workflow. Just like how Uncle Bob mentioned in his tweet, how when you go
[07:14] from working with two agents to three agents, he becomes a bottleneck. Coding
[07:18] with AI, and I mean actually letting AI do the majority of the work requires a
[07:23] complete change in how you actually work. And there's a big resistance when
[07:28] it comes to this change. Using coding agents like clot code and codex app is
[07:32] vastly different than copying and pasting code into a chat or even using
[07:37] an extensionbased coding assistance like client and rue. While client and rue
[07:41] will assist in the actual implementation task by task. Cloud code and codeex is
[07:47] meant to abstract away the implementation which changes the rule of
[07:51] the game from coding to what's called specdriven development or just
[07:55] orchestrating between tasks. The codeex app for example doesn't even show you
[07:59] the code in the application and viewing diff edits is done outside of the main
[08:04] chat window. So given this underlying change we're going through in terms of
[08:09] AI adoption among developers lack of trust in AI's response continual layoff
[08:14] but hiring still being below the baseline. Do you think this progression
[08:19] will lead to AI replacing software developers or do you think AI will
[08:23] create even more demand for software developers?
