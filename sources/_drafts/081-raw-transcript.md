[00:00] Okay, so this is probably the biggest
[00:02] story in the tech right now. Peter
[00:03] Steinberg, who is the creator of
[00:05] OpenClaw, is joining OpenAI. OpenClaw is
[00:08] going to become a foundation and is
[00:10] going to be independent and will remain
[00:13] an open-source project.
[00:15] Now, OpenClaw has been on a roll for the
[00:18] last few weeks. It's the fastest growing
[00:20] open source project and really a glimpse
[00:22] of what personalized agents could look
[00:24] like. Now I have talked about a security
[00:27] nightmares of this project but finally
[00:29] we have a big player behind the project
[00:31] because uh this project was so far
[00:33] mainly managed by a single person. I
[00:36] think this has been a roller coaster
[00:37] ride for him as well. He had to change
[00:39] the project name three times in a span
[00:41] of just 72 hours. Here's a tweet from uh
[00:44] Sam Alman. We're going to go through the
[00:46] blog post and also the timeline of the
[00:48] events that have been pretty incredible.
[00:50] So he says, "Peter Steinberg is joining
[00:51] OpenAI to drive the next generation of
[00:53] personal agents. He is a genius with a
[00:56] lot of amazing ideas about the future of
[00:58] very smart agents interacting with each
[01:00] other to do very useful things for
[01:03] people. We expect this will quickly
[01:05] become core to our product offerings. So
[01:08] you can actually see an indication of
[01:10] where the direction of OpenAI is going
[01:12] to be going. They want to get into the
[01:15] personal agent space. OpenCloud will
[01:17] live in a foundation as an open source
[01:19] project that OpenAI will continue to
[01:21] support. The future is going to be
[01:24] extremely multi- aent and it's important
[01:26] for us to support open source as a part
[01:28] of that. Now with this news there are
[01:30] people who are looking for alternative
[01:33] even though it is going to remain open
[01:35] source. So here is Igger Babiskin who
[01:39] was the co-founder of XAI. So he's
[01:42] saying what's the best open alternative
[01:44] to open cloud right now doesn't make
[01:47] sense to pull all your data into it if
[01:50] it's owned by openai. Now according to
[01:53] Peter it's going to remain open source
[01:55] not owned by openai. So here is Ron from
[01:58] OpenAI in response to that tweet from he
[02:00] says these are locally stateful agents
[02:03] that send traffic to the model provider
[02:05] of your choice. Actually, now that I say
[02:08] it, I'm guessing Enthropic will ban
[02:10] using Opus from Open Claw just to spite
[02:13] us. If you have been following the story
[02:16] of OpenClaw, Anthropic has been a really
[02:19] big part of it because initially it was
[02:21] called Cloudbot. Anthropic forced Peter
[02:25] to change the name, then it became
[02:26] moldbot and then open claw. In response
[02:29] to the Ron's tweet, I actually pointed
[02:32] out this is how it uh works today in
[02:34] open claw and uh that is awesome but if
[02:37] an openi changes the direction and make
[02:40] themselves a first class citizen in the
[02:43] ecosystem that is not awesome and that
[02:45] is one of the biggest concerns right now
[02:47] that people have that okay how much
[02:49] influence openai is going to have on the
[02:52] project and what direction they can take
[02:55] it in. We don't know that yet. Now,
[02:58] here's a ex user who points out a really
[03:00] good point that Peter has previously
[03:02] said in some of his interviews. So,
[03:04] Steinberg have has made his prerequisite
[03:08] and ideals non-negotiable and he seems
[03:11] credible and upright in that would
[03:13] change like this be an easy to spot in
[03:16] an open-source project and I think Peter
[03:18] has talked about it that um one of his
[03:21] requirements of joining a company was
[03:23] that openclaw is going to remain open
[03:26] source. Okay, so if you're interested,
[03:28] here's the timeline of uh how this
[03:30] project came into being and all the
[03:33] craziness around it. So it started as a
[03:36] personal project back in November 2025
[03:39] and in December it went viral. So it
[03:41] crossed 60,000 GitHub stars and on
[03:44] January 9 blocked the access of third
[03:47] party open source projects from using
[03:51] their oath token that cloud code uses.
[03:54] There was a big backlash around it, but
[03:57] then Anthropic force uh Pet Peter
[04:00] Steinberg to change the name from
[04:02] Claudebot to moldbot. On the same day,
[04:07] scammers seems to have hijacked old
[04:09] accounts in under 5 seconds, which is
[04:11] kind of crazy. Then Peter Steinberg
[04:14] wanted to change the name to OpenClaw.
[04:16] He checked with Sam Alpen. According to
[04:18] some of his interviews, there was also a
[04:20] project called Molt Book, which is
[04:22] supposed to be a social network for
[04:24] agents that also started late January.
[04:28] Every there were there has been a lot of
[04:30] uh security related concerns for Open
[04:33] Claw. Then on one of the interviews with
[04:37] Lex Freriedman, uh Peter Steinberg said
[04:40] that he's in talks with both Meta and
[04:42] OpenAI for a potential employment
[04:46] agreement for him and keeping the
[04:48] project open source. And now on February
[04:50] 15th, Peter Steinberg is joining OpenAI
[04:54] to work on personalized or personal
[04:58] agents while the project itself is going
[05:00] to remain open source. So in all this I
[05:03] think Anthropic has missed a great
[05:05] opportunity to be the go-to provider for
[05:09] non-developers in the form of personal
[05:11] agents like open claw. It has more than
[05:14] a million users now. Uh and I think it
[05:16] would have been a great opportunity for
[05:18] anthropic to just continue supporting
[05:20] the project. maybe even provide credits
[05:23] to Peter Steinberg for developing it
[05:26] because he did say that um Opus or the
[05:28] cloud models as operating models in
[05:30] OpenCloud are pretty great. Now that
[05:33] might change a little bit. Okay, so
[05:35] here's the article or blog post that
[05:37] Peter Steinberg posted in response to
[05:40] the events that have happened. So in
[05:42] here he says I'm joining OpenAI to work
[05:44] on bringing agents to everyone. OpenClaw
[05:47] will move to a foundation in stay open
[05:50] and independent. Now he talks about the
[05:52] last month events uh which I think was
[05:56] crazy for everybody involved. Then he
[05:58] has talk he talks about his own kind of
[06:00] struggles with all this because if you
[06:02] are bombarded by so many different
[06:05] opportunities in different directions I
[06:06] think it's really hard to keep up. And
[06:09] the good thing is that Peter has
[06:11] actually openly talked about this uh on
[06:13] Lex Freedman podcast. Now, then he goes
[06:16] on to say, "When I started exploring AI,
[06:18] my goal was to have fun and inspire
[06:19] people. And here we are. The lobster is
[06:22] taking over the world. My next mission
[06:24] is to build an agent that even my mom
[06:28] can use." And that's going to be I think
[06:30] the next frontier because uh developers
[06:32] are pretty comfortable using these
[06:34] agentic systems now. But the main
[06:37] usefulness or challenge is to make it so
[06:40] easy that non-developers can easily use
[06:44] it. And I think uh with OpenAI behind
[06:47] Peter that's going to become a lot more
[06:49] easier to do. There are definitely
[06:51] concerns around who is going to be
[06:54] defining the direction. I think we'll
[06:55] have to see what happens there. Now then
[06:58] he says yes I could have totally see how
[07:00] open claw could become a huge company
[07:03] and no it's not really exciting for me.
[07:05] I am a builder at heart. I did the whole
[07:07] uh creating a company game already,
[07:10] poured 13 years of my life into it and
[07:13] learned a lot. Keep in mind Peter is not
[07:15] just a random developer. He had a
[07:18] company. He already retired by selling
[07:21] that company but in he came back to
[07:23] building personal software or personal
[07:25] agents in the form of Open Claw. Then he
[07:28] says, "What I want is to change the
[07:29] world, not to build a large company, and
[07:32] teaming up with OpenAI is the fastest
[07:34] way to bring this to everyone." I spent
[07:37] last week in San Francisco talking with
[07:38] the major labs, getting access to the
[07:41] people and unreleased research and it's
[07:45] been inspiring on all the fronts. So he
[07:48] says, "Ultimately, I felt OpenAI was the
[07:50] best place to continue pushing on my
[07:52] vision and expand its reach. The more I
[07:54] talked with the people there, the clear
[07:57] it became that we both shared the same
[07:59] vision. Now community around open is
[08:01] something magical and open AI has made
[08:04] strong commitments to enable me to
[08:05] dedicate my time to it and already
[08:07] sponsor the project to get this into the
[08:10] proper structure. I'm working on making
[08:13] it into a foundation. uh it will stay a
[08:15] place for thinkers, hackers and people
[08:19] that want a way to own their data with
[08:23] goal of supporting even more models and
[08:25] companies. Now I think the good thing
[08:27] that is going to come out of it is going
[08:29] to be that hopefully they're going to
[08:32] resolve all the security issues and claw
[08:34] is going to remain the law but we are
[08:37] already potentially seeing some backlash
[08:40] or responses from other countries. Now
[08:42] uh this is just you one user so I don't
[08:44] want to generalize it. Here's Alex who
[08:48] is the host of Thursday AI podcast. He
[08:50] says new users are out of luck with open
[08:53] claw and open for six question mark.
[08:56] Just tried to set it up. Um, anthropics
[08:59] maxplant does not seem to work anymore
[09:02] via set of token and signing up to an
[09:05] API tier doesn't work as API rate limits
[09:10] basically kill any possible usage. I
[09:12] finally convinced my fiance to try and
[09:16] she's upset as heck right now. One thing
[09:19] they already blocked the oath that was
[09:23] used for cloud code. So if he has tried
[09:25] that's not going to work. But the rate
[09:29] limit thing I'm not sure it might be
[09:31] based on the account that he was using.
[09:34] It doesn't probably have high enough
[09:35] rate limits on it because open claw eats
[09:39] through the tokens very quickly and
[09:42] that's by design. Now there are already
[09:44] people calling the project closed claw.
[09:46] We'll have to see. I think it's probably
[09:49] premature to say that. and uh seems like
[09:52] he's going to be working on or with the
[09:54] Codex team. So, we're going to see how
[09:56] this thing is going to evolve, but I
[09:59] think there's hope that the project is
[10:01] going to not only survive, but thrive.
[10:04] Let's see what happens and what the
[10:06] future holds. Anyways, I hope you
[10:07] enjoyed this quick video. Thanks for
[10:09] watching and as always, see you in the
[10:11] next one.
