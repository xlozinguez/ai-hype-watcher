[00:00] Today's number, 219.
[00:03] That's how many hours it takes on
[00:05] average for adults to go from friends to
[00:07] best friends. Today's other number is
[00:10] 1,000. That's how many hours I've spent
[00:13] with Scott Galloway. However, I still
[00:15] haven't made it out of the acquaintance
[00:17] zone.
[00:22] Welcome to Profy Markets. I'm Edson. It
[00:24] is February 19th. Let's check in on
[00:26] yesterday's market vitals. The major
[00:29] indices paired gains after the Federal
[00:31] Reserve minutes were released. The
[00:32] official record of their last meeting
[00:34] reveal rising concerns over inflation.
[00:37] It also showed several officials may
[00:39] want to raise rates if inflation
[00:41] persists. That news sent Treasury yields
[00:44] climbing. Meanwhile, Bitcoin fell to
[00:46] roughly $66,000.
[00:49] Okay, what else is happening?
[00:53] Anthropic and Open AI have grabbed most
[00:56] of the headlines recently, but Chinese
[00:58] companies have been busy releasing very
[01:00] powerful AI models of their own. It
[01:03] seems that Luna New Year, which began on
[01:05] Tuesday, has become China's unofficial
[01:07] launch season. Alibaba kicked things off
[01:10] with Renbrain, a model designed to help
[01:13] robots understand the physical world.
[01:15] They also unveiled Quen 3.5, a coding
[01:18] and agent focused model that is up to
[01:20] five times faster than its predecessor.
[01:22] Meanwhile, Bite Dance dropped Seance
[01:24] 2.0, a video generation tool, as well as
[01:27] Duba 2.0, its deep reasoning model. And
[01:30] then ZepO released GLM5, which is
[01:33] engineered for agentic intelligence. The
[01:36] through line behind all of these
[01:38] announcements, all of these models are
[01:40] reportedly matching and even beating US
[01:43] competitors on multiple key benchmarks.
[01:46] Okay, here to break down this season of
[01:49] launches, we're speaking with Propy
[01:50] Media's very own Alice Horn, co-host of
[01:53] the China Decode Podcast. Alice, good to
[01:55] see you.
[01:56] &gt;&gt; Hi, Eden. Happy New Year. Happy Year of
[01:57] the Firehorse.
[01:58] &gt;&gt; Happy Year of the Firehorse. um that
[02:01] seems to be part of the story here,
[02:03] which is right as the Luna New Year
[02:05] shows up, we see tons of new models
[02:09] coming out from these Chinese companies,
[02:10] these new AI models. Uh Seance, uh Duba,
[02:15] uh GLM5, I mean a lot of these names are
[02:19] kind of dominating the headlines at
[02:20] least in China. Uh what do you make of
[02:22] these new AI models that have come out
[02:25] of China? Uh how important are they?
[02:28] what do they mean uh for consumers and
[02:30] investors?
[02:31] &gt;&gt; Well, Ed, it's definitely true that
[02:32] Chinese AI has bolted from the stables
[02:35] to borrow a horse metaphor. And as you
[02:37] rightly say, we've got a couple of
[02:39] models that have just come out, uh
[02:41] GLM. Uh we've also got Quen, the new
[02:44] Quen 5 Max model that's come out. We've
[02:47] also got new AI video generation models
[02:50] that have taken Hollywood, I think, by
[02:52] huge surprise and shock and
[02:54] conststonation. But generally when I
[02:56] look at the models and I've I've been
[02:57] using them in the last few days, what's
[03:00] clear to me is that they have improved.
[03:02] They are faster. Uh they are more
[03:05] cost-effective if you obviously compare
[03:07] them to the closed uh proprietary models
[03:09] offered by OpenAI as well as uh by
[03:12] Claude for instance. Uh but really the
[03:15] my frustration with this debate is that
[03:16] it's apples to oranges. People are going
[03:18] to use the Chinese models differently. I
[03:21] think the fact that Brian Chesy, the
[03:22] Airbnb CEO, says outright a couple
[03:25] months ago that a lot of his engineers
[03:27] are using this uh for aentic uh chat
[03:30] bots uh because it's cheaper and faster
[03:32] seems to suggest that the use cases for
[03:34] this are very different the Chinese
[03:36] models that is than the American closed
[03:39] models. Firstly, a lot of engineers and
[03:41] just everyday people are using and
[03:43] experimenting with the Chinese models.
[03:44] Quinn, for instance, they're downloading
[03:46] them locally, fine-tuning them, and
[03:48] using them for their particular use
[03:50] cases. Uh, any kind of projects that
[03:52] they may be involved in. It's it's got
[03:54] improved privacy because they're
[03:56] downloading it locally. It's cheaper,
[03:58] often 10 to 20 times cheaper than what's
[04:01] offered by OpenAI and Claude. So,
[04:03] really, they're using this very
[04:04] differently from say potentially you and
[04:06] me, Ed. I use CLA a lot uh the
[04:09] enterprise level because the reasoning
[04:11] is exceptionally good when it comes to
[04:13] the geopolitical analysis the financial
[04:15] analysis that I'm involved in. So the
[04:17] way that I think about it is that the
[04:19] American models are really focusing on
[04:21] precision on reasoning at the highest
[04:23] level as a as a really quest for AGI.
[04:26] The Chinese models are really um
[04:29] figuring out how to create a market in
[04:31] which everyday people, engineers,
[04:34] corporates even uh downloading them
[04:36] locally, experimenting, fine-tuning uh
[04:38] and just capturing the benefits of
[04:40] cheaper, faster models. So, I don't
[04:42] think there's a direct comparison and I
[04:44] think that a market exists for both
[04:46] these models, so to speak, to coexist.
[04:48] &gt;&gt; One of the things that we're also seeing
[04:50] is just the benchmarking. I can't tell
[04:53] how seriously I'm supposed to take these
[04:55] benchmarking leaderboards. It seems that
[04:57] things are constantly shifting. But when
[04:59] you look at the leaderboards, when you
[05:01] look at the stats on which is the best
[05:04] model, which is the best performing, the
[05:06] fastest, what, however you define best,
[05:08] I'm not sure how they define it, the
[05:10] Chinese models tend to be the best or at
[05:13] least they they tend to be at the top of
[05:16] the rankings. What do you make of that?
[05:18] Does that mean that the Chinese models
[05:20] are better? Uh does that mean they're
[05:23] going to overtake the American models or
[05:26] again is this perhaps maybe apples to
[05:28] oranges and these these benchmarks maybe
[05:30] don't make sense?
[05:31] &gt;&gt; Well, I love that you asked that
[05:32] question. I I think often that the
[05:34] benchmarks can be red herrings. There's
[05:36] a good Harding principle uh in computer
[05:38] science that is applied to this which uh
[05:41] suggests that even although they may
[05:43] meet those benchmark goals and exceed
[05:45] the other models uh there are certain
[05:47] unquantifiable goals and performance
[05:50] outcomes that they may still be inferior
[05:52] in certain respects to the claudes and
[05:54] the open AIs of the world. So again,
[05:56] back to my previous point at I really
[05:58] think that if you care about privacy and
[06:01] and cheapness and speed, maybe you go
[06:03] for Quen, you go for you go for
[06:05] Kimmy, but if you care about, you know,
[06:08] frontier cutting edge reasoning, uh,
[06:11] precision, then you are still going to
[06:12] favor the Clauds and the open AIs. Uh,
[06:15] so it's really different universes that
[06:17] they inhabit. And I think benchmarks can
[06:20] often be red herrings even although
[06:22] there's an incentive for these models to
[06:24] come out and say that we're exceeding uh
[06:26] the benchmarks of other rivals and
[06:28] competitors. But again, you know, cost
[06:31] is something that uh is directly
[06:34] comparable. Uh it's no surprise that the
[06:36] Chinese models are 10 20 times cheaper.
[06:39] Uh and I think that that with cost
[06:41] deflation uh inertia will continue to
[06:43] favor the Chinese. At what point will
[06:45] the will the cost really change and
[06:48] shift the way the market works here? I
[06:50] mean consumers I think they know about
[06:53] open AI. They're beginning to know about
[06:56] Anthropic and learning about Claude. So
[06:58] there's some maybe some brand loyalty
[07:00] there. But I feel like at a certain
[07:02] point if you're presented with an option
[07:04] that is 10 or 20 times cheaper, you go
[07:06] with that option. So I guess my what I'm
[07:09] a little confused about is when is that
[07:12] going to happen? Is that not going to
[07:14] happen? Is that not a giant concern for
[07:17] a company like OpenAI or Anthropic or
[07:20] even Google with Gemini?
[07:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But I do think when we look at
[07:24] technology diffusion and value creation,
[07:26] the way that the software economy really
[07:28] came out of the US and US dominated that
[07:31] and the value created by software. It's
[07:35] really I think going to be uh the clauds
[07:39] and the open AIs uh that benefit from
[07:42] the enterprise part of the value chain.
[07:45] Uh the enterprise can pay for it and you
[07:48] know they tend to be stickier in terms
[07:50] of the subscription. So I think that
[07:53] we'll end up in a world in which maybe
[07:55] the majority of the value is captured by
[07:58] anthropic, by open AI, but that doesn't
[08:01] mean that there won't be anything left
[08:02] on the table for Alibaba, for uh bite
[08:06] dance, uh for Kimmy. It's just a
[08:08] different market that they're
[08:09] inhabiting. And we haven't even talked
[08:11] about some of the other use cases.
[08:13] There's uh now Chinese AI chatbot toys
[08:16] that is going to be a big market, I
[08:18] think. Uh, and certainly it marries well
[08:20] with China's manufacturing and hardware
[08:22] capabilities. So,
[08:23] &gt;&gt; toys.
[08:24] &gt;&gt; Toys. Yeah. There these toys that are
[08:26] being sold that can speak directly to
[08:28] children and teach them uh and and
[08:31] interact with them in I don't know if
[08:33] you've ever read read Neil Stevenson's
[08:34] Diamond Age, but it's this kind of AI
[08:36] primma that is part of this story. We're
[08:39] already living in that diamond age, so
[08:40] to speak, in this sci-fi realm. That is
[08:43] one area. And then another area in which
[08:45] the the I would say open AI and
[08:48] anthropic have not been as competitive
[08:50] is in multil language. If you look at
[08:52] the models coming out of China, it makes
[08:54] sense because they've been trained a lot
[08:56] on on multil- language English Chinese
[08:58] and other language uh data sets. They
[09:01] tend to be better at uh at other
[09:03] languages. And so if you're a a global
[09:05] company where you care about a Chinese,
[09:07] Asian speaking market, uh that could
[09:09] also be quite uh an important
[09:11] distinction.
[09:12] One name we haven't mentioned which was
[09:14] very popular about a year ago seems to
[09:16] be less popular today is Deepseek.
[09:19] Where does DeepSeek sit in all of this?
[09:22] &gt;&gt; Well, I I think Deepseek is still a
[09:24] leader. They still have a lot of the
[09:26] highlevel AI talent and that counts a
[09:29] lot when you think about the AI
[09:31] competition domestically and globally.
[09:33] Uh I do know for a fact although I'm not
[09:35] sure if I should say this that uh
[09:37] Deepseek uh is working a lot with local
[09:40] governments uh with government bodies in
[09:43] China uh to integrate AI into uh local
[09:47] public governance and I think this is
[09:49] coming at a time where you know Ed we'll
[09:51] be watching with baited breath in the
[09:52] next two weeks or so because the 15th
[09:56] 5-year plan is going to come out and
[09:57] it's very very clear now that AI plus is
[10:01] going to be a huge cornerstone stone of
[10:03] the policy for the next 5 years. So AI
[10:06] in every realm including in public
[10:08] governance and and public uh service and
[10:11] utilities. So Deepseek is still a
[10:14] player. Uh but I think the latest models
[10:16] coming out of Alibaba even Kimmy uh show
[10:20] us that in China at least the AI race is
[10:23] hyper competitive. It's not uh just a
[10:25] duopoly uh which it's or or even
[10:28] centered around three players which is
[10:30] increasingly what's happening it seems
[10:32] in the US is many different players and
[10:34] I think they can capture different parts
[10:35] of the market.

[13:16] We're back with property markets.
[13:19] President Trump's chaotic trade policy
[13:21] has rattled Europe and some countries
[13:23] are weighing new methods to push back.
[13:26] For Sweden, that means reconsidering its
[13:28] use of the croner as its currency and
[13:30] switching to the euro. The country's
[13:33] finance minister just backed a formal
[13:34] inquiry into euro adoption, which would
[13:37] strengthen the country's trade ties to
[13:39] the EU. A full embrace of the EU's
[13:40] common currency would also be a vote of
[13:42] confidence in the euro, just as the
[13:44] dollar's dominance has fallen into
[13:46] question. In the past year, the euro has
[13:48] climbed 13%. Meanwhile, the dollar has
[13:50] declined 9%. Okay, for more on what
[13:54] Sweden's currency plans mean for the
[13:56] dollar and also for the US, we're
[13:57] speaking with Robin Brooks, senior
[13:59] fellow at the Brookings Institution and
[14:02] former chief FX strategist at Goldman
[14:05] Sachs. Robin, thank you for joining us
[14:07] on Profy Markets.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah, my pleasure. Thanks for having me.
[14:10] So this uh decision or we haven't
[14:14] reached a decision but at least Sweden
[14:16] appears to be mulling over the prospect
[14:18] of ditching the croner which they've had
[14:20] for years and moving over to the euro.
[14:24] Uh it appears that this kind of has to
[14:27] do with the relationship between the US
[14:29] and Europe or at least global
[14:31] uncertainty. This seems to be somewhat a
[14:34] response to that. Take us through why
[14:36] this is happening. Why is Sweden
[14:38] considering this? So, as you know, um, a
[14:43] bunch of European countries got together
[14:44] back in the '90s and they decided to
[14:48] form a common currency. The euro was
[14:51] formed in began in 1999. There were a
[14:57] bunch of countries that did not join uh,
[15:01] the euro when it was created. the UK
[15:04] where I'm guessing you have a little bit
[15:06] of a connection and then Sweden
[15:10] obviously Denmark, Poland, uh Czech
[15:13] Republic, Hungary. So it's not first of
[15:17] all any kind of outlier status to not be
[15:22] in the Euro. Countries at the time had
[15:25] referenda on whether joining the Euro
[15:28] was a good idea. Sweden did one in 2003
[15:31] and it was rejected by a margin of 56%
[15:35] of the vote was against joining the
[15:38] euro. The margin in terms of popular
[15:42] opinion polls now has moved in the
[15:44] direction of joining the euro. You're
[15:46] totally right about that. That's mostly
[15:49] about geopolitics.
[15:52] So a fear that in particular Russia's
[15:55] invasion of Ukraine just makes the world
[15:58] less safe. The US is less of a
[16:01] predictable ally. And so it must be that
[16:04] some Swedes think joining the euro gives
[16:07] you that extra safety. If that is what's
[16:10] going on, then I think that's poor
[16:12] reasoning because the euro is really
[16:15] just a system of currency pegs. It
[16:17] doesn't confer any kind of safety. You
[16:21] just have to ask the Baltic states, for
[16:23] example, Estonia, Latafia, Lithuania, do
[16:26] they feel any safer from Russian
[16:28] invasion because they're members of the
[16:30] Euro? No. Poland, uh, the finance
[16:33] minister
[16:34] just said, you know, we think the Euro
[16:36] is a great idea, but we prefer to be on
[16:39] the outside than on the inside. Um, so I
[16:43] think whether or not from a geopolitical
[16:45] point of view this is a smart decision,
[16:47] I think it's totally up in the air. It
[16:48] sounds like dumping the crone at taking
[16:51] the euro would mostly be a symbolic
[16:53] gesture to say we stand with Europe uh
[16:58] and and that it wouldn't really have
[16:59] much impact or whatever impact it would
[17:01] have would maybe not even be good for
[17:04] Sweden. Is there an element of
[17:06] ddollarization or debasement in this
[17:10] whole conversation? I mean, one of the
[17:12] big themes we've been exploring recently
[17:14] is the fact that increasingly people are
[17:17] wary of the dollar. They're concerned
[17:19] about debt levels in the US. They're
[17:21] turning to things like gold. And I I
[17:24] just wonder if the euro as the next most
[17:27] popular currency, if there's an argument
[17:30] to be made that we should be transacting
[17:33] in euros, maybe people in Sweden think
[17:35] that that's the reason why you switch
[17:37] over to the euro. Is taking on the
[17:39] dollar a part of this conversation at
[17:42] all or is that also a red herring?
[17:43] &gt;&gt; First of all, I think you're asking
[17:45] exactly the right question. There's a
[17:46] survey of uh central bank reserve
[17:50] managers. So these are, you know,
[17:51] picture all the sovereign wealth funds
[17:53] in Asia, all central banks that have
[17:55] piled up tons of dollars and other
[17:56] foreign exchange reserves. These guys
[17:58] manage trillions of dollars. And this
[18:01] survey is done by the IMF. That's once a
[18:03] quarter and it surveys what is your
[18:06] allocation of your reserves to dollars
[18:08] versus euros versus Swiss Frank versus
[18:11] Swedish corona etc. The amazing thing is
[18:14] that with all the noise last year, you
[18:18] know, just think back to Liberation Day,
[18:20] the big drop in the dollar in April
[18:23] 2025, you know, as we went through the
[18:26] year,
[18:28] the altercations that President Trump
[18:30] had with the Fed, the massive rise in
[18:33] gold prices that we saw after October in
[18:37] particular, the allocations that foreign
[18:40] reserve managers are making to the
[18:43] dollar have been totally stable. There
[18:46] has been no flight from the dollar.
[18:49] There's also been no flight into the
[18:52] euro. That's pretty remarkable when you
[18:54] think about all the noise that we've
[18:56] had. So, I think the lesson that I draw
[18:59] from that is the hurdle for the dollar
[19:02] to lose reserve currency status, for
[19:04] there to be serious dollar to basement,
[19:08] it's pretty high. But again, for Sweden,
[19:11] this is a really big opportunity. Sweden
[19:15] traditionally has always been considered
[19:17] kind of a high beta currency. It's super
[19:20] volatile. You you didn't really want to
[19:22] hold it because it banged around all
[19:24] over the place uh on news. Most
[19:27] recently, so over the course of the last
[19:30] 69 months, the Swedish Crona has started
[19:32] trading like the Swiss Frank. So like a
[19:35] safe haven currency. So when global
[19:38] uncertainty goes up, for example,
[19:40] liberation day tariffs, Swedish crona
[19:44] actually does well. So I would put the
[19:46] Swedish crona in the same bucket as
[19:50] gold, silver, platinum, you name it. Um,
[19:56] it is this safe asset. What exactly is
[20:00] going on with dollar to basement? I
[20:02] think is a separate question. And
[20:04] incidentally, the dollar is up today
[20:05] because the FOMC minutes talked about
[20:08] hikes and that surprised the markets. So
[20:11] I think there's clearly a flight to
[20:12] safety. What exactly people are fleeing
[20:15] from isn't quite clear yet.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; It's interesting because foreign
[20:19] exchange currencies, these are
[20:22] conversations that are typically in the
[20:24] purview of investors, Wall Street, think
[20:27] tanks, economists, etc. But the
[20:30] dolorization question has generated a
[20:33] lot of heat and a lot of people are
[20:35] interested in it and I think because it
[20:37] communicates a possibility that this
[20:39] world order that we've all known and and
[20:42] lived with for so many years that where
[20:45] you know the US is the dominant power
[20:47] there is an a hegemony of America it's
[20:50] reflected in the strength of this
[20:52] currency that that may be coming to an
[20:54] end and I would add you know a lot of
[20:57] investors are making trades off of this
[21:00] macro possibility, which is why we're
[21:03] seeing what we're seeing with gold. But
[21:04] it sounds like you as a real currency
[21:07] expert, as the chief FX strate former
[21:09] chief FX strategist uh at Goldman, it
[21:13] sounds like your view is that maybe this
[21:14] is a little bit overdone. Um if you're
[21:17] actually looking at the the global
[21:21] reserves of the dollar that actually
[21:24] this isn't this is more kind of bulk
[21:26] than bite. Well, I mean, we know that in
[21:30] the United States, fiscal policy is kind
[21:32] of out of control. Debt is on a
[21:35] trajectory that is not good at all.
[21:38] Deficits are out of control. The thing
[21:41] is that's true for many other countries,
[21:44] too. Everyone is in trouble on fiscal.
[21:47] And so, in a relative sense, the United
[21:50] States is worrying, but relatively
[21:53] speaking, it doesn't look that bad. So
[21:56] when you look at for example risk
[21:59] premium in the bond market on treasuries
[22:02] over other comparably measured
[22:05] government bonds in other countries
[22:08] actually the United States smells like
[22:10] roses.
[22:11] That sounds crazy. So I think where we
[22:14] are is that there is a debasement trade
[22:17] for sure. It's just not clear whether
[22:19] that debasement trade is against the
[22:21] dollar or against all fiat currencies
[22:24] together. Yeah, I think the question I
[22:26] always return to is sure, maybe it's
[22:28] bad. What's your alternative? Exactly.
[22:30] Is it the euro? Is it the UN? Is it
[22:33] Bitcoin, which is also kind of bad as a
[22:36] form of currency? Uh is it actually
[22:38] gold? These are all very interesting
[22:41] questions. We are out of time, but thank
[22:43] you for joining us, Robin Brooks, senior
[22:45] fellow at the Brookings Institution.

[23:02] is to do everything you can to set your
[23:04] clients up for success. There are plenty
[23:06] of ways you can go about it. Maybe a
[23:08] leveling up of your fixed income
[23:09] strategy, but bonds can be tricky. The
[23:12] market is huge, rates shift, and risks
[23:14] hide in plain sight. That's why having a
[23:15] partner with scale and expertise
[23:17] matters. Vanguard brings both. Vanguard
[23:20] bonds are institutional quality.
[23:21] Institutional quality isn't a tagline.

[23:35] star portfolio managers. Like it's all
[23:37] about that one brilliant mind making the
[23:39] magic happen. Vanguard's philosophy is a
[23:41] little different. They believe the best

[24:04] We're back with Profy Markets.
[24:07] So yesterday we discussed this feud that
[24:10] is unfolding between the AI company
[24:12] Anthropic and the Pentagon or more
[24:15] specifically the Secretary of War Pete
[24:17] Hegsath. And before we end here, I'd
[24:20] like to unpack that story a little bit
[24:22] because I think it tells you a lot about
[24:24] where we are in this AI moment. So, just
[24:28] to refresh your memory, one of
[24:29] Anthropic's biggest customers is the
[24:31] Defense Department, which is paying
[24:33] hundreds of millions of dollars to use
[24:35] their AI tools. But as of this week,
[24:38] Secretary Hegsth has threatened to cut
[24:40] ties with Anthropic. He has even gone so
[24:43] far as to put them on the supply chain
[24:46] risk list, which is a label that is
[24:48] usually reserved for foreign
[24:50] adversaries. They're also threatening to
[24:52] cut ties with any company that does any
[24:54] business with Anthropic at all. In some
[24:57] Anthropic is now on the administration's
[25:00] list. They do not like that.
[25:02] Question is why? Well, it all centers
[25:04] around two main disagreements. Number
[25:07] one, Anthropic has told the Pentagon
[25:09] that they do not want their technology
[25:11] to be used for autonomous lethal
[25:14] weapons, i.e. robots that kill people.
[25:17] And then number two, they also don't
[25:20] want their technology to be used for
[25:21] domestic mass surveillance, i.e. spying
[25:24] on American citizens. And according to
[25:28] the Defense Department, this is a deal
[25:31] breakaker. In fact, such a deal breaker
[25:33] that they now view anthropic as a
[25:35] potential risk to America. So, there's a
[25:38] lot that is concerning about this. The
[25:40] fact that we're now requiring that AI be
[25:43] used for things like drone strikes, also
[25:45] that we're requiring that AI be used to
[25:47] spy on Americans and surveil them. These
[25:50] facts are scary in and of themselves.
[25:53] But what is perhaps more striking is the
[25:57] hypocrisy here. The fact that this is
[26:00] coming from an administration that has
[26:02] long stated that this is exactly the
[26:04] kind of thing we need to avoid. The
[26:07] threat of government surveillance, of
[26:10] big tech surveillance. Trump himself
[26:12] said that one of the goals of the
[26:14] campaign was to quote monitor our
[26:17] intelligence agencies to ensure they are
[26:19] not spying on our citizens. Jim Jordan
[26:22] warned of the quote collusion of big
[26:24] tech and big government. JD Vance the
[26:27] vice president cautioned about companies
[26:29] quote using artificial intelligence to
[26:32] surveil Americans. He said I worry about
[26:35] invasions of privacy. So this is exactly
[26:38] the thing that MAGA was supposed to
[26:42] prevent this collaboration between the
[26:45] government or the deep state and also
[26:47] with technology companies to surveil the
[26:51] American people. And now we find
[26:53] ourselves in this very ironic position
[26:56] where an AI company actually doesn't
[26:58] want to move in that direction. They
[27:00] don't want to surveil citizens. They're
[27:03] down to work with the government, but
[27:04] they're not down to spy on Americans.
[27:06] And for that they are being punished.
[27:09] Now we can dwell on the hypocrisy here.
[27:14] It is quite striking. But that might
[27:16] also be missing the point. I think the
[27:18] larger point is we now know where this
[27:22] is all headed. And that is despite the
[27:24] virtue signaling arguably from both
[27:26] sides about the need to reign in big
[27:28] tech to reduce the surveilling powers of
[27:30] the largest corporations and of the
[27:32] government. I think it is pretty clear
[27:34] now that is not going to happen. AI will
[27:38] be used for weaponry. AI will be used
[27:41] for autonomous lethal drones and
[27:45] operations. AI will be used to track
[27:47] Americans, to spy on Americans, to
[27:49] surveil Americans. This is simply where
[27:52] we're headed now. And I should also be
[27:55] pretty clear here. Most other companies
[27:57] aside from Anthropic are on board for
[28:00] this. Companies like OpenAI, companies
[28:03] like XAI, Google, and of course,
[28:06] Palanteer, they are all down. Now, the
[28:08] only thing that might get in the way
[28:11] here is the same thing that I wrote
[28:13] about in my newsletter this week, and
[28:15] that is the American people. As I've
[28:18] written, AI is becoming increasingly
[28:21] unpopular. Less than half of Americans
[28:23] say they like AI. Less than a third of
[28:26] Americans say they trust AI. And it
[28:28] could be that this is the straw that
[28:31] breaks the camel's back. That voters
[28:33] decide, actually, we don't like this
[28:35] direction. We don't want this
[28:37] technology. We don't like how it's being
[28:39] used. And therefore, we're going to do
[28:41] something about it. We're going to vote
[28:43] you out. That could happen. And I think
[28:47] the political ramifications of AI is now
[28:49] something that investors need to take
[28:51] really seriously. We can't really ignore
[28:53] it. Having said that, there are still
[28:56] many Americans that don't really know
[28:58] about AI, that perhaps don't really care
[29:00] about AI. And so until this reaches a
[29:03] boiling point, I do think that the
[29:05] current trajectory is the most likely
[29:08] that AI will become fused with
[29:10] government. It will enable a
[29:12] surveillance state. It will be used to
[29:14] track people, target people, and
[29:16] sometimes kill people. Everything that
[29:18] MAGA said that they were supposed to
[29:20] prevent, ultimately that will transpire.
[29:23] That is where the trend is moving and
[29:26] barring some extraordinary event that is
[29:29] likely where it will end. Thanks for
