[0:00] there's been sort of almost a perhaps a deliberate lost in translation, a disconnect um where I I think people
[0:06] think that these 7.5 hours or this 14,000, you know, a year would be a
[0:14] saving for them. And it's like, no, that's that's not that's not the way it works. Unfortunately, you're looking at
[0:20] a situation where companies are on one side thinking about the productivity gains they can get and workers are on
[0:27] the other side trying to figure out exactly how to make that happen for their job. What happens to those
[0:33] employees when they burn out? Because what we're seeing at the moment is, you know, the first sort of wave of them,
[0:39] right? You know, there will be a wakeup call and a reckoning for the entire sectors um who who deal with, you know,
[0:44] office workers especially who who are adopting AI. there's there's going to be a reckoning.
[0:56] Joining me on the tech report today is the tech journalist Natasha Bernal. Thanks for coming on. Thank you for having me.
[1:01] So, I saw some ongoing research by the Harvard Business Review. They're working with a US-based tech company to sort of
[1:09] try and get a better understanding of AI adoption in in the workplace. What they
[1:14] found so far is that employees that have incorporate incorporated AI into their workflows sort of the quickest and have
[1:21] already kind of like got that workflow going, they're the ones that are already showing signs of burnout and sort of
[1:28] being stressed from overloaded at work. And I'm sure people at home will know what that is. Why why are the people who
[1:35] have embraced AI the most becoming more stressed? Yeah. So this this bit of research I
[1:41] think is super interesting because essentially um they were talking about a company that didn't mandate AI use. So
[1:47] there were no requirements, no targets that these employees needed to to meet. But what they found was that the um they
[1:53] felt like using AI made doing things feel more possible. So they were working more hours, they were working on more
[2:00] diff and and intrinsically uh you know complex things. Um and what they found
[2:05] was that that quickly translated into um an unsustainable situation where they um
[2:12] the initial I suppose enthusiasm for AI adoption and you know people being excited about using different AI tools
[2:19] turned into uh almost like a a chore I suppose. Um and they they found that
[2:25] their workload which had expanded thanks to AI which allowed them to do more things wouldn't contract back to where
[2:31] they found it manageable. um before using AI and so they found themselves themselves trapped into basically a
[2:38] massively increased workload um and they they didn't really enjoy it and so that's that's why the burnout um has
[2:46] become a thing. It's certainly you know burnout has been a topic of conversation in the workplace for for many many years
[2:51] now. Um but AI burnout is is something that you know is has not been explored
[2:56] as extensively because you know the adop adoption of AI has is still quite limited in the workplace. And so um it
[3:03] is interesting to see that you know that quiet transition between being really enthusiastic and really excited about
[3:09] using AI and then finding that actually they've they've been trapped in a situation they cannot escape. Um, and I
[3:16] guess the researchers in in this in this piece of work were talking about the challenges that business leaders have
[3:22] where they need to kind of almost set boundaries for AI and set boundaries for
[3:27] the way people are using AI so that they can avoid this burnout and saying, you know, you need to train people on how to
[3:33] use it. Um, you need to help them use it, but also you need to be aware that
[3:38] if you do not set, you know, some guardrails in place, you're going to be in a situation where things will quickly
[3:43] spiral out of control. It seems kind of counterintuitive because we were kind of sold AI as this this timesaver.
[3:51] So why does sort of the speed gained from AI translate into longer hours
[3:57] rather than shorter hours according to this study? Yeah. So people were talking about basically this being a kind of blurring
[4:03] of the boundaries between work and nonwork. Um so AI would help um at the
[4:08] beginning of the tasks for work. Um and it would make it starting something really easy. So rather than opening a
[4:14] Google doc or or a word document where it was completely blank and they had to sort of come up with the first sentences
[4:20] themselves and start you know thinking about things themselves as office workers um they could get an AI tool to
[4:27] start that process for them and therefore it made it easier for them to say okay I've almost like gone over that
[4:34] first hurdle of that creative block that you might have looking at something for the first time and I've got something to
[4:39] work on and now it's about perfecting what the AI has says. Um, it's about, you know, making it make sense, adapting
[4:45] it to the work that I'm doing. Um, and probably factecking what that AI has told me. Um, which is, you know,
[4:51] perceived, I suppose, to the human brain is as a lot of an easier, uh, process to do than thinking about the entire thing
[4:58] yourself. And so, um, you know, they they produced an effect that was basically a workday with fewer natural
[5:04] pauses. You might go away, you might have a think, you might, you know, consider what you how you might approach
[5:10] a task. um you might start writing and then delete everything that you've said. Um but what what happened here was
[5:16] because they had the AI starting the work for them. Um they had more continuous involvement with their work
[5:23] and you know the the conversational nature of AI meant that they had um
[5:28] almost like a you know a chatting experience um that felt less like a formal task which made it easy for them
[5:35] to start spilling work into the evenings and into their spare time. um without the intention of of doing that. And so,
[5:43] you know, it was it is one of those things that I think is is quite I
[5:48] suppose indicative of of where we are now as a society and the way that we treat work. There is an expectation that
[5:54] you will do that you will do your job, that you'll do it really well, but also that you will do the job for as long as it takes, even if that means it kind of
[6:02] interrupting into your evening. A lot of people still work in a hybrid or in a in a work from home capacity. And so, it is
[6:07] easier for that to happen. um in those in those contexts, but but we've had that in the office as well, like you
[6:13] know, people working extremely long hours to get targets and tasks done uh find themselves in a situation where
[6:19] they're burning out. And this is this is just another instance of that. Um and it feels interesting that it was the it was
[6:26] the workers themselves that were putting themselves in that situation rather than it being imposed from above, which I
[6:32] think might be the scenario that's playing out in other businesses. And how much of the that stress do you think
[6:37] comes from this anxiety that employees will have that they're kind of training their future
[6:43] replacements or whether whether or not that is uh going to happen. Yeah, I think that's that's huge, right?
[6:49] I mean, I'm sure you know, you've heard of people that are worried about that that situation occurring and there is a
[6:54] lot of chat about um you know, what what all of this will mean if you're not, you
[6:59] know, if you're not on the bandwagon of AI, like if you're if you're the person who's like the only one in your department or the only one in your
[7:05] business who doesn't embrace AI. Um if you're the only one, it's not a good situation to be in. And so, a lot of
[7:12] people do find themselves trying to um use AI in some way at work. Um it is it
[7:18] is very difficult though to keep that thought from from being you know in your
[7:23] mind especially if you're in a situation where you are um relying on AI to you
[7:29] know accelerate this the pace at which you're able to do work and you know I don't know how you feel about this Isaac
[7:35] but I feel like it's really hard if you're in a situation where AI is doing
[7:40] the kind of menial tasks of your job to then work at 100% of your capacity.
[7:47] using like loads of brain power the entire time in your job. It just doesn't feel like a sustainable situation. Like
[7:52] I know, you know, people have been selling us AI to do the more menial tasks in our jobs for for a long while
[7:58] now, but I just don't I don't know that it's necessarily such a good thing to not have something
[8:04] that allows you to still be fulfilling the tasks of your job every once in a while because we cannot work at 100% the
[8:10] whole time, right? The way that I think about it is everybody has that that those meetings which could have been an
[8:16] email and it's just like everybody complains about them. But I think kind of like being like in an airplane or
[8:23] something like that, you they give you those moments where you aren't expected to be doing something aside from the
[8:29] community aspect of going to these meetings or whatever else. like having moments where you aren't being expected
[8:35] to work or or you're doing some work and it's a little bit mindless so you can be
[8:40] a little bit sort of lost in your thoughts as you're just copying over some some text or whatever. Having those
[8:46] moments of working at a slower pace I think are needed otherwise exactly the
[8:52] reason for burning out is you're working too fast for too long and you just have no time to sort of feel like you can
[8:58] slow down. Yeah. And I suppose there is that um that expectation that everything has to
[9:04] be an efficiency, right? And sometimes, as you say, human interactions in meetings, especially if they're in real
[9:10] life, that they're not necessarily for that. You can't necessarily have that creative spark or those good ideas if
[9:16] you're going, okay, the agenda is this. These are the bullet points that we want to cover here, and you know, we'll do this in the maximum most efficient time
[9:23] possible, and then there you go. Um I mean the amount of meetings I've sat in where people have said things like oh
[9:29] you know that one where it goes um tell me one thing that people don't know about you and you have to go around the
[9:35] room and I I honestly I do think there is a limit to why is it useful to be done in a meeting and I feel that for me
[9:42] is like the the different it's if it's if it's that sort of thing I'm kind of like no that's not useful. We we don't I
[9:47] don't want to do that. I never have a good fact. I don't I make one up every single time and it's more outrageous the
[9:53] the longer I spend in the world of work. But um but yeah, if it if it's something that feels like you're trying to spark
[9:58] creativity and you're trying to get people working together, it's like a muscle, isn't it? If you don't exercise it, you're not going to use it. And
[10:05] that's that's I think um the concern for many people when they're looking at um using AI in the workplace. They don't
[10:10] necessarily want to not exercise those muscles, right? They want to make sure that, you know, they don't lose the
[10:16] ability to do research. they don't lose the ability to ask questions in interviews. They don't want to lose the ability to to, you know, make sure that
[10:22] they can think on their feet, which is a huge skill that a lot of people have worked really hard to hone and that is
[10:29] actually really valuable in in the world of AI. Um, in a world in which AI is is more prevalent. Um, so yeah, so I I
[10:36] don't know about um this whole working at 100% all the time. I think it's it's very difficult for it to be sustainable.
[10:43] But what I do know is that the world of work is it does follow trends and it
[10:49] does feel like if you have a situation where the majority of your workplace is working at 100% and that's your company
[10:55] culture um and they are using AI in order to get there it is very difficult to break out of that cycle and that that
[11:02] does repeat across the whole workforce right where you've got a situation where if that becomes the norm then we're all
[11:08] going to be burned out and there's going to be a big problem here. Um, I remember during the pandemic we were talking
[11:13] about generation burnout. Um, and it feels like like the echoes of the past.
[11:18] I'm like, are we going to start talking about this again? Because it is it does feel very familiar to that. I think the
[11:25] assumption that I mean certainly I made and I think a lot of other people made when we were told that AI we were
[11:30] promised that AI would boost productivity was that AI would be the thing on top of
[11:36] us boosting that productivity rather than we are the thing pushing up the AI
[11:41] to be more productive and then having to put in all of that extra effort to make AI be more productive if that makes
[11:48] sense. Yeah. Do do you think it's kind of become a bit of like a like the promise is actually a bit of a poison chalice in
[11:54] a way? A little bit. Right. Because I I and this this is something that you know I have to admit in my work I don't tend to
[12:01] use AI. I don't I don't think that it's necessarily um the best way to do things. As a
[12:08] creative person, I don't think that it's it's tremendously useful. Um, but I do
[12:14] also have a huge skepticism which isn't is just born out of watching LLMs
[12:19] develop, right? And you know that a lot of the time the information that you get is not from reputable sources. You know
[12:25] that the information that you're getting may not be reliable and you don't want to be that person. I've been in so many meetings where people have told me you
[12:31] don't want to be that person who shows up to a meeting with their bosses, tries to say something clever, and then they
[12:36] say, "Where did you get that from?" And you say, "It's chat GPC." You do not want to be that person, right? And so um
[12:41] it it is is difficult because um I suppose you you're replacing those
[12:46] mundane tasks of like starting a blank piece of paper by asking chat GBT or
[12:52] Grock or Copilot a question and helping you fill in some blanks to then having to go back to those mundane tasks and
[12:59] saying okay I have to now check everything to make sure that it's correct because I can't rely on the
[13:05] information that it's giving me. And even even the best LLMs are are based on information that is is you know out
[13:12] there that you can't if it was you doing it you would check it right so you still
[13:17] have to you still have to it's sort of the um the equivalent of using Wikipedia you just don't you don't use that as a
[13:23] as a source of of information and I guess that's that's I I feel that's the
[13:28] trap that we're in that you're being asked to use something that you cannot necessarily rely on in a serious manner
[13:34] in a very serious way for your job. And you know, people being told that your targets are tied to using AI to me is
[13:40] super harsh. Um, you know, but there have been other bits of tech that this has happened before. You know, this is
[13:47] it's like a tale all this time, right? They tell you you must adopt this technology. You must do this. You must do that. And you've got your outliers
[13:53] who say, "No, I'm not going to do that. I don't trust it." Um, and then eventually we're all swept away. But um
[13:58] but I feel as LLMs get more reliable and better and they have more capacity to to actually you know produce uh actionable
[14:06] intelligence that people will feel more confident using it. But certainly it feels like you're replacing doing the
[14:12] research yourself with factecking someone else's which is I wouldn't say that's less work at all.
[14:17] Yeah. I want to get into and touch on the sort of tying AI usage to performance reviews because Meta's
[14:23] essentially said they're going to start doing that. But I in in preparing for this, I was reading a story earlier
[14:29] today about someone who it was a writer uh but they had been moved on to
[14:34] essentially being an editor or or a verifier kind of both things at once for AI written content. Their rate was h
[14:42] haveved just under the assumption that the editing would take half the time or
[14:47] at least less of the time. But the reality was obviously that it took kind of double the time to double check
[14:53] everything and then often just essentially rewrite the whole thing. What it really kind of made me realize
[15:00] is that there is there's a bit of a gulf between what people are the people who are mandating AI use and then the people
[15:07] who are actually the ones then having to use it. And I just wanted to know what you thought the reasons were for that
[15:14] difference between how employees see the reality of of using AI at work and
[15:20] employers sort of their expectations of how AI can be used at work. Yeah. I think the best the best example
[15:27] to illustrate that was I was reading some research uh recently. It's like a report that came out at the end of of
[15:33] 2015 I want to 2015 2025 pardon me what year am I in? Um yeah, so it it was it was
[15:40] talking about um the the impact that AI could have on on GDP and it was a a
[15:48] penal University of Pennsylvania report um basically saying that 40% of current GDP could be substantially affected by
[15:55] generative AI um and that you know the the the boost to growth is the
[16:01] strongest. they they estimated based on this sort of projection of the future um
[16:06] that the the growth of of the economy might be strongest in the early 2030s um
[16:11] that they expected that AI might help to contribute 0.2 percentage points in 2032 if things continue along the way that
[16:18] they do right now. Um and this is an interesting opportunity and I think a lot of companies are thinking in this
[16:24] way they're going we would like to you know get get a piece of that pie. We would like to increase our productivity.
[16:30] You know, LSSE research has shown that, you know, AI can save an average of 7.5
[16:35] hours per week, which is about 14,000 per employee per year in productivity
[16:40] gains. And these businesses and these business owners are going, you know, of course, we would like to to capitalize
[16:46] on on these on these um efforts and we would like to see all of these savings
[16:52] um for us. I think it's it's different though that that when you think about things as a as a employee or as a worker
[17:00] um I I just think that there's been sort of almost a perhaps a deliberate lost in
[17:05] translation a disconnect um where I I think people think that these 7.5 hours
[17:12] or this 14,000 you know a year would be a saving for them and it's like no
[17:18] that's that's not that's not the way it works unfortunately. I wish it did. I wish it meant that, you know, you or I
[17:24] could go home half an hour earlier. Um, you know, or seven and a half hours less a week we would have to work to get the
[17:30] same salary. But that's in reality not not what happens. And with any kind of technology that we've seen the same
[17:36] thing over and over again, right? And so I think the the interesting thing here is this this productivity drive which
[17:44] you know companies and and and business leaders are trying to push towards. Um, but the devil's in the detail, right?
[17:49] this this um research from the University of Pennsylvania was very clear that you know after after that bump in the 2030s we're going to see
[17:57] productivity levels go back to normal so what happens then right and that that's
[18:03] the question when when you go okay what what occurs uh for for this bump to not continue at pace and I guess you know
[18:09] obviously this is we're in a predictive uh situation at the moment LLMs are not you know a tech could come in and
[18:15] completely disrupt what we know right now about AI and turbocharge it to levels that we've never seen before. And
[18:20] of course, everything could change uh by 2030. Everything could change in 2026.
[18:26] We don't know. Um so I but I do think that um we're in a situation where, you
[18:32] know, the productivity gains at the moment would be, you know, AI takes on
[18:37] some of the percentage of of someone's job. They do those things. Then that
[18:42] kind of regulates. So the expectations on people grow, the amount of productivity that's needed per worker
[18:49] grows. Um, you know, maybe the investment in each worker grows. I mean, goodness knows that would be really
[18:54] good, especially in Europe because we're not really on a par with the US um in terms of productivity investment per
[19:00] worker. Um, but I digress. It's it's basically you're you're looking at a situation where companies are on one
[19:07] side thinking about the productivity gains they can get and workers are on the other side trying to figure out
[19:12] exactly how to make that happen for their job. But they have I suppose both
[19:17] the AI is going to take my job on in the back of their minds and also hopeful that AI is going to save them some time
[19:23] and neither thing seems to be occurring. That's basically what's happening here in my view. I don't know. Do do you feel
[19:30] the same? The way I see it, there's been like a lot of historical trends of there
[19:35] will be something that will will save you time. Like the the one that always comes to mind for me is is the
[19:41] dishwasher, which was obviously from when the dishwasher was invented. It was pitched towards women housewives. It was
[19:47] like it will free you up to do all of the things that you want to do in the day. I think that's more or less a quote from the adverts that were on the TV at
[19:53] the time. But the reality was that you would then fill that time with more things that you could do and then
[20:00] somehow instead of the to-do list being done quicker, the to-do list would then
[20:05] grow to fill the time you had because you could do more. And so, yeah, the the
[20:11] way that I see it is it's it's kind of this it's now just with AI instead of the dishwasher or what whatever it is
[20:18] that instead of kind of it's freeing us up to have more time to do the things we
[20:23] want to do, it's putting more pressure on us to do things quicker because we
[20:29] can. And I I feel like that is probably something that a lot of people can relate to with sort of the internet and
[20:35] social media in the last couple of decades like things getting a lot busier
[20:41] both sort of mentally but also in terms of the work that you're expected to do and especially obviously in our industry
[20:46] it's gone from you get the newspaper every every day if you're lucky to 24-hour rolling news which just somehow
[20:54] you have to be talking the whole time. Yeah. I love the analogy of the dishwasher cuz Yeah. I mean, you think about, we're talking about the 1920s
[21:00] when that became a thing. Um, and and you you think about the world then, you
[21:05] know, it was one person in the household that would have a job um that would sustain all of the rest. And then the
[21:11] expectation is, oh, well, you know, since we've got all these different electrical appliances that can help you out, you know, why not, you know, work
[21:17] work longer? But also, you kind of need that because suddenly you need two salaries. And now the norm is, you know, you have two salaries. The dishwasher's
[21:23] on the in the evening. you're hoping for the best, you know, and and it's it's very difficult to manage and a lot of
[21:28] people, you know, in the UK certainly, you know, you need you need two salaries to be able to to survive, which, you
[21:34] know, at the beginning when the dishwasher was first brought forward, I I can imagine that a lot of people have sold that dream of it's going to be it's
[21:41] going to allow you a life of leisure in certain way, like you can put your feet up and enjoy yourself. And that
[21:46] obviously didn't play out that way. And I feel that's um yeah that's un I wish it did though the utopian dream of of of
[21:54] having a bit of an easier life. Um but it feels also similar somehow to again
[22:00] yeah you're talking the advent of the internet um and how much easier things are and I think you know there there are
[22:06] certain elements of AI that that are really good right if they can spark your imagination that's great. I think my
[22:12] concern and I think the concern of of others is that you lose skills as a result and those skills might come in
[22:18] handy later on down the line if you need to differentiate yourselves from AI. So
[22:24] that's the issue, isn't it? Yeah. The cognitive offloading I think is the term I've seen used. I I mean if
[22:30] if AI adoption starts to be defined more at least in the near term as by stress
[22:37] and and layoffs as well which we'll get into and more questionable and certainly
[22:43] questionable returns on investment for for the people putting this in place.
[22:48] Where does that leave sort of the hype and the confidence that is propping up this high spending on the AI buildout
[22:55] that we're seeing at the moment? I don't think it matters. I hate to say it. I don't think that like workers saying,
[23:00] "Oh, this is making us really stressed out and actually there's burnout will do anything at this juncture." I mean, I
[23:07] think, you know, um that there is a big push towards AI adoption. I feel like, you know, businesses are are really
[23:13] trying to find that competitive edge and keep it. Um and, you know, a lot of them
[23:19] have decided that AI will help them do that. And until that changes, until that strategic change um happens that that I
[23:27] mean that would be the thing to to change the the mindset. If you have really big businesses that decide
[23:32] actually no, we're not going to invest in AI because we don't believe in it. If there was a sort of mind mindset change
[23:38] from from sea suite, then that would be the thing to to change. But I don't think unfortunately that workers
[23:44] complain about burnout or anything like that will will make will change the the turn of the tide for for AI for sure.
[23:50] Um, I think where where things could get a bit gnarly is if you have a situation
[23:55] where some other bit of technology comes along and blows um, LLMs out of the water, whether it's another type of AI
[24:02] or something completely different. Um, and then businesses have to make a choice between that or or their current
[24:08] choice of LLMs. And I think that's that's where we might see the tide turn a little bit. Um, but we don't know what
[24:15] that might be if if it exists at all. on that point and and coming back to what
[24:20] something you mentioned earlier with the with the AI sort of performance review tie-in, Meta has announced that well not
[24:28] announced but sort of told their employees that they will be tying AI usage to performance reviews and a
[24:34] revised bonus system which is all kind of a bit a bit murky for those I'm sure
[24:40] working there let alone us. Um, do you do you think that trend is it kind of follows from what we've been saying, but
[24:46] it kind of creates this sort of performative productivity culture?
[24:51] I mean, look, you know, Meta has Llama. Um, Meta really needs people to use Llama. Um, if Meta pays your salary, um,
[25:00] it can force you to use Llama. Um, and that's that's, you know, it's a it's a business that's trying to push AI. Of
[25:07] course, it's trying to lead from the front. It makes sense. it this this reminds me a massive amount of some of
[25:12] the stories that you know I've written and and read in the last 10 years um which talk about you know people who are
[25:19] tied to time performances people who are tied to you know uh the the the
[25:25] different use of sales force that was a big thing back in the day oh my gosh um
[25:30] yeah like you know different different tools that you know suddenly a business will decide yes that's really important to us yes we absolutely need people to
[25:37] use it no we don't care how much um you know people don't want to use it or they might not find it useful. We're going to
[25:43] implement this mandate and I I guess you know it kind of just reminds me of that. It's just a new iteration of that. Does
[25:50] that mean that the way that they're using it is going to be more creative and better? Not necessarily. It just means that more people are going to be
[25:55] using the AI itself. And I can see how for a company like Meta, you know, having your own work workforce as sort
[26:02] of evangelists of its own technology would make a total amount of sense. Um I I think it's Yes, you do enter into the
[26:09] territory of performess as you were saying like where you have people that are just going okay well you know I
[26:15] could I could write an email or I could get you know llama to write it for me and then I'll copy paste it answer an
[26:21] email and then hope hope for the best. That's is it's totally totally the case that that if that's the way to get a
[26:28] bonus why wouldn't you do that and why wouldn't you try to gain the system? Um but the interesting things come from
[26:33] that. I mean you you remember during the pandemic when um a lot of businesses started you know measuring keystrokes to
[26:38] make sure that people were working um because they didn't believe that people could work from home um surprise
[26:44] surprise they they are more productive than ever working from home and it's hugely disappointing thing that people being forced back to the office but you
[26:50] know it's it's to me anyway so you're like in the office sorry Isaac but um it's fine
[26:57] but um but when they started measuring key strokes and then people found a a workaround for that when they started
[27:03] using facial recognition and people found a worker like people will find ways to gain the system but also to you
[27:11] know be like okay I can see that this is nonsense if it is nonsense to them um and I I I can I can fix it for myself.
[27:19] So, I would expect more people if this becomes a widespread trend, um, find
[27:24] ways to, you know, use AI, but in a way that perhaps their bosses would just not
[27:31] really be that interested in in doing. And it's non impossible to be tracking
[27:37] what all of your employees are using AI for the entire time. Um, I think just
[27:42] the the thought of looking through all that data, even if you had access to it in an easy manner, is is terrible. I
[27:48] mean, I know Slack is is really widely used in a lot of workplaces and you technically as an administrator can look
[27:54] into, which by the way, this is a good tip for for our people watching, you know, if you do use Slack, you don't put
[28:00] anything private on there or or anything that you wouldn't want to be read out in an HR disciplinary um because it is it
[28:07] is something that they can access, but they don't. And the reason why they don't is because there's such a volume of messages that it becomes
[28:13] unmanageable. And the same goes with AI. Unless there's a motivation for it, it's
[28:18] it's not something they're going to track. And so, you know, I' I'd be very interested to see exactly what parameters Meta W was giving to its
[28:26] employees. Do you know whether they were like saying, "Oh, your bonus is contingent on you using like Llama to do
[28:34] XYZ activities." From from what I understand, they they had freed up their
[28:40] employees to use other previously they're restricted to only using Llama, but now they've been freed up to use
[28:45] other AI agents as well or or LLMs rather as well. Um from what
[28:51] I understand there is uh something called I think it's called Checkpoint where they are using this software to
[28:59] essentially not measure their sort of active usage of AI but rather it's
[29:05] measuring their output and assessing it for the usage of successful I think was
[29:11] a very particular part successful usage of AI. I'm I'm not that I don't know
[29:17] that much more than that, but it does seem a little bit more than just kind of the keystroke checker,
[29:23] but also it's a little bit seems a bit of a of a hat on a hat to make sure your
[29:29] employees are using AI when they might not necessarily need to be using it in the first place.
[29:35] That seems like a bit of a um can of worms, right? If you if you have software that's analyzing whether
[29:40] they've used it correctly or not or I mean there's so many things there that could go wrong right and you know you
[29:47] end up arguing against an algorithm which is not an ideal situation for for any worker to be in because it could
[29:52] decide oh your your job is you're so unique that you clearly couldn't have
[29:57] used AI when in fact you were using AI the whole time. Who knows? It's very
[30:02] hard. And I think recently they did have a little a wave of of firings for uh I
[30:08] think they used the term underperforming employees or something like that which was I don't know if that then starts to be
[30:14] tied in with AI performance reviews then it's it's yeah not a not a a good picture at least for the employees
[30:20] there. Not happy at all. No. touching on that a little bit, I just want to end things off by talking about sort of AI and the
[30:27] impact on jobs because if the the expectation being that AI would reduce
[30:33] the amount of jobs required, but if it turns out that actually AI just makes you work harder,
[30:39] will we not need more people to make AI functional rather than less?
[30:44] Um, I'd say no. it still follows because if you're working harder and you're
[30:49] allowing your work to go into the evenings or early mornings um and you you are you're doing more then you know
[30:56] you're you're doing the job of the AI that you were concerned about right
[31:01] you're you're taking other people's jobs um by by working so hard that you're burning out right so I I guess you know
[31:08] if you have fewer employees that are working at a higher capacity that are using AI as crutches almost as fuel to
[31:16] to propel them forward um to do the job faster then you would still need fewer employees. So I would say that that pace
[31:22] wouldn't necessarily slow um down. I think the the the question that I have
[31:28] certainly moving forward is uh you know what happens to those employees when they burn out because what we're seeing
[31:35] at the moment is you know the the first sort of wave of them right and you kind of wonder what exactly will happen when
[31:42] you have a a workforce that is is no longer able to perform that is you know
[31:47] being signed off sick because of stress um that is that is costing the company money um because it's they've been
[31:54] pushing too far and and quite rightly so, having to take, you know, time off to to recover. Um or or you have a
[32:01] workforce that, you know, we've seen what happens to people in Japan. Um I
[32:06] don't think anybody here would would want that. um where you've got people who are dropping dead due to exhaustion
[32:12] where you've got a culture that is incredibly uh you know toxic in the workplace to the point where you know it
[32:17] has its own name and its own culture and and you know there people who've spoken about this and tried to combat it and
[32:23] all that sort of stuff. I think if that's a trajectory we're going into that's hugely concerning for the workforce and and certainly something
[32:29] that I feel you know business leaders have the responsibility to stop. Um it it just it's it beggars belief that you
[32:36] would be in a situation where you'd be happy about that if you have like a lot of your workforce going off sick because
[32:43] they're they're they're in burnout and they can't they can't get out. And I'd be interested to see those labor numbers
[32:49] and like how many people are dropping out of the workforce or having to leave their chosen profession because they
[32:55] don't feel like they can cope anymore. Um because I I mean you mentioned that that article about that writer and that
[33:00] that's that's the thing that happens, right? You start off by saying, "I'll adapt to this technology. I'll try to do
[33:06] my best." And then you end up in a situation that's completely untenable. And you go, "Well, what's the point, right? I'm just I don't want to do this
[33:12] anymore. It's not fun. It's not something that I, you know, set out to do, you know, when I studied or when I
[33:19] trained to do this job." Um, and so what's the point? And so, yeah, I'd be interested in seeing the drop of the of
[33:24] the workforce, but also to see if if what the article is saying is true, that there are more people that are turning
[33:30] to like different sectors completely and different jobs completely saying, I'd like to do things that involve manual
[33:35] labor because I find it more relaxing actually than than my office job. If that is the case, then I think, you
[33:41] know, there will be a wakeup call and a reckoning for the entire sectors um who who deal with, you know, office workers
[33:47] especially who who are adopting AI. There's going to be a reckoning. I just want to end on one final question
[33:53] actually. Do you think the AI pro productivity promise the AI productivity
[33:59] boost was a lie? It depends on which which promise
[34:07] if you're asking sorry if you're asking the question of of like okay if the
[34:13] promise was it will take away mundane work then yes I believe that's that's true. If the promise is it will make you
[34:21] uh be more free and that it will free you up to do work that you enjoy more, I
[34:27] feel that that is kind of the case. But it's a it's it's be careful what you wish for um because it's a poison
[34:33] chalice because the stuff that you really enjoy doing um is perhaps a very small percentage of your job and doing
[34:39] that the entire time um may take the fun out of it quite quickly. Well, Natasha Bernell, thanks for taking
[34:45] the time. Thank you so much.
