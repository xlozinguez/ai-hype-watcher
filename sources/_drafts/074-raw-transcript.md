[00:00] The end of programming as we know it was
[00:04] an article written by Tim O'Reilly
[00:06] almost about a year ago and there were a
[00:09] lot of interesting ideas discussed in
[00:11] that and so it's always nice to kind of
[00:13] look back at things. I think a lot of
[00:15] people only look forward, but it's good
[00:17] to look back in time and look at how
[00:19] people were talking about things, you
[00:22] know, even just a year ago and kind of
[00:25] seeing where we're at today because a
[00:27] lot of the claims made in that article
[00:29] were the overall thesis was that
[00:31] programming has changed. The way we did
[00:34] programming before is different. It's
[00:36] over. But programming has still not gone
[00:39] away. It's going to just be different
[00:40] going forward. And I think given that a
[00:42] year has passed, so much more progress
[00:45] has been made in the last year than I
[00:47] would have anticipated. So I just want
[00:49] to say that I was definitely wrong about
[00:52] certain things, certain assessments that
[00:53] I made. Now, in fairness, nobody can
[00:57] precisely predict the future. If you're
[00:58] going to make predictions, you're going
[00:59] to be wrong at some point. And I am not
[01:03] here to like win an argument. I'm not
[01:06] pro AI or against AI. I just prefer to
[01:09] be in touch with reality. And for me,
[01:12] reality doesn't mean hopping on the
[01:14] bandwagon that everybody else is on.
[01:16] Because we know that about a year and a
[01:18] half ago when everybody was saying that
[01:20] cursor and a lot of these tools are
[01:23] making them 10x developers or 100x
[01:26] developers now. It was just full of BS.
[01:29] It was just not true. And so I pointed
[01:31] out, at least for me, that was just not
[01:34] true. That was not my reality. But right
[01:36] now, I think I see some people overly
[01:41] dismissive of AI just because we know
[01:45] that the boy has cried wolf over and
[01:47] over again. Why should you believe it
[01:49] now? Well, let me just say it's just my
[01:51] opinion, but I think in November of last
[01:54] year, there was definitely an inflection
[01:56] point. We got to a point where I
[01:59] realized that well, okay, even if AI
[02:01] doesn't get any better from here, things
[02:04] will never be the same again. But what
[02:07] does that actually mean? Because I would
[02:10] say right now, we're still at the point
[02:12] where like programming has changed, but
[02:15] it still hasn't gone away. And honestly,
[02:17] if I had to bet money, I think a year
[02:20] from now, we're going to be in the exact
[02:22] same boat. We're going to say
[02:24] programming has changed dramatically,
[02:26] maybe even more so, but still it still
[02:30] involves a lot of human input. It still
[02:34] involves a lot of human understanding
[02:36] not just of the concepts of like how to
[02:39] use an agent how you know the learning
[02:42] curve of using something like clawed
[02:44] code which you know my humble opinion
[02:47] I'm not an expert on using them but I
[02:49] think you get most of the value out of
[02:51] using these tools pretty quickly and the
[02:55] rest of the value that you get like it
[02:57] involves knowing how to code because you
[02:59] kind of have to know what you can get
[03:00] away with when you're using the AI tools
[03:03] like, okay, you can implement certain
[03:04] things and certain things that you can't
[03:05] and certain things to double check and
[03:07] certain things that you can maybe gloss
[03:09] over, but that requires understanding
[03:12] how to code even if you don't
[03:13] necessarily handype your code anymore,
[03:16] which I guess most people aren't doing
[03:18] anymore. I'm certainly not handwriting
[03:20] very much code anymore, and I see that
[03:23] many experienced engineers are also
[03:26] doing the exact same. So when you see
[03:28] that online, when you see that nobody's
[03:30] writing code anymore, it can kind of
[03:32] make you think that coding, knowing how
[03:34] to code, knowing how to read code isn't
[03:37] important anymore. But I definitely do
[03:40] not think that's the case right now. If
[03:42] I just had to guess, I don't think
[03:45] that's going to be the case a year from
[03:46] now. Because when we're talking about
[03:49] the idea of AGI, the idea of the
[03:52] singularity, the idea of the cure to
[03:55] cancer, the infinite computations,
[03:58] philosophically at least, like it almost
[04:01] feels like we're trying to get closer
[04:02] and closer to like God or like the God
[04:05] particle or like the origin of
[04:07] intelligence or, you know, from a math
[04:10] perspective, like a neutral analogy
[04:12] would be we're getting closer and closer
[04:14] to infinity. But you know that infinity
[04:17] is like an idea. The closer you get to
[04:20] it, you realize you're the same distance
[04:22] away from it. So I know that's kind of a
[04:24] strange analogy. It's not going to win
[04:27] an argument for me or anything, but you
[04:29] have to understand that what we're
[04:31] trying to do with this AI is exactly
[04:35] that. We're trying to create a general
[04:37] form of intelligence, whether it's
[04:38] coding intelligence or some other
[04:40] intelligence, so that it can do pretty
[04:42] much everything. And if it can't do
[04:44] everything, it's definitely going to
[04:46] require human input. Another, I guess,
[04:48] analogy you could say, if you actually
[04:51] take a second to think about like the
[04:54] current state of programming, like I
[04:55] said, over the last 3 months, things
[04:57] have drastically changed. And it's not
[05:00] even clear how much things have changed
[05:02] until you actually continue to use and
[05:04] use a lot of the AI tools. Because even
[05:07] for me, like I had that moment in
[05:10] November and even in December where I
[05:12] realized, wow, like these tools are
[05:14] better than I would have expected. In
[05:15] the past, it was the reverse. Every time
[05:17] I used it, I was like, who who the hell
[05:19] is hyping this? Because I'm trying to
[05:20] use it in my codebase. It ain't doing
[05:23] what everybody says it should be doing.
[05:25] But right now, it's doing more than you
[05:27] might expect. But at the same time, if
[05:31] you would have told me that this is
[05:34] where we would be at three years ago or
[05:36] even a year ago, I would have thought
[05:39] that it would feel different than it
[05:43] does, right? And if that doesn't make
[05:46] sense, think about this even further
[05:48] back. like 20 years ago if somebody told
[05:50] you if you're working on some company I
[05:53] I don't know exactly what things were
[05:54] like 20 years ago but you know it was
[05:55] kind of distributed systems were getting
[05:58] really really big right and if somebody
[06:00] would have told you that actually 10
[06:02] years from now you know 2015 2020 we're
[06:05] going to have cloud providers and AWS I
[06:09] think they launched in 2006 or something
[06:11] it's not just going to give you VMs it's
[06:14] going to give you pretty much everything
[06:16] you could possibly need the the concept
[06:19] of scaling databases and having like
[06:21] autoscaling and even the cost aspect of
[06:25] it like pay per use and all these things
[06:29] if somebody would have told you that
[06:30] this is the future this is what the
[06:31] world is going to look like you know I
[06:33] certainly would have thought that
[06:35] probably there's going to be a lot less
[06:37] programmers right like that sounds like
[06:39] you're taking a lot of the hard parts
[06:41] out of programming there's probably
[06:43] going to be a lot less programmers we're
[06:46] probably going to be shipping so quickly
[06:48] the world is going to look something
[06:49] like a utopia. We're going to have, you
[06:51] know, so much value being created in
[06:53] every direction. And it's it's really
[06:56] not the case. I don't know. Is it the
[06:58] hydonic treadmill? Have we gotten used
[07:00] to it? Are we just over consuming? And
[07:03] you know, what is it? I don't know what
[07:05] exactly it is, but clearly it wasn't
[07:07] like that before the AI stuff happened.
[07:10] And so now going from, you know, late
[07:13] 2022 to the beginning of 2026, if
[07:16] somebody told you that AI is going to
[07:18] get this much better in such a short
[07:21] period of time, you would say that if
[07:24] coding is a solved problem, which I
[07:27] don't know if you could exactly make
[07:29] that argument, but you could make
[07:31] something of an argument that coding,
[07:34] not development, designing, and all that
[07:37] sort of stuff, but if you can be
[07:39] specific specific enough with your words
[07:41] of what you're trying to accomplish
[07:42] which usually it's going to take a
[07:43] programmer to do that then the code will
[07:46] write itself because that's what I mean
[07:48] when I say we hit an inflection point
[07:50] that if you have a really really
[07:52] specific design doc for example you kind
[07:54] of generally say that okay the these are
[07:56] the design decisions I want to make this
[07:58] is the type of queries I want to run
[07:59] these are the access patterns this is
[08:01] the architecture this is the API
[08:04] interface and stuff like that you you
[08:06] give these things to claude or some
[08:08] other tool I'm not I'm not promoting
[08:10] Claude or anything, but if you give it
[08:11] to Codeex even, it's pretty much just
[08:14] going to crank that thing out for you.
[08:16] Okay. So So why isn't the world a utopia
[08:19] yet? That's what I asked myself. Where
[08:21] is the cure to cancer? Why can't we find
[08:23] it? Because like I said towards the
[08:25] beginning, the closer you get to
[08:27] infinity, it's like deceptive. You're
[08:29] still the same distance away from it,
[08:31] right? And it's like the hydonic
[08:32] treadmill. You'd think that at this
[08:34] point, humanity, we've solved, we've
[08:37] nearly solved life. We have abundant
[08:40] food. We have food, water, and shelter.
[08:43] But certain things just have not
[08:45] changed. And I know this is kind of a
[08:47] wacky philosophical argument. Fine. But
[08:51] I I still think it's relevant because
[08:53] like I said, okay, imagine a year from
[08:56] now, let's say not just coding, but
[08:58] actually software development is a
[09:00] solved problem. Nobody is developing
[09:02] anymore. Okay, mass unemployment. But
[09:05] what is that world going to look like? I
[09:07] don't think it's going to feel that
[09:09] different than today. And I also don't
[09:12] think we're we're going to get to that
[09:14] either. I don't think we're going to
[09:16] recreate intelligence. I don't think
[09:18] we're going to recreate God. I think
[09:20] those are the two hardest problems in
[09:23] the universe. Understanding the origin
[09:26] of life and consciousness and
[09:28] understanding the origin of the
[09:30] universe. And obviously uh everybody has
[09:32] their own personal beliefs about stuff
[09:34] like that. But I think those two
[09:36] questions are pretty much the same
[09:38] question, right? At least in my humble
[09:41] opinion. And so when we get to AGI and
[09:44] this kind of this god intelligence, the
[09:47] singularity and stuff, I think things
[09:49] just start to break down. I don't think
[09:52] the question even makes sense anymore.
[09:55] So anyways, concretely, what does this
[09:58] actually mean? At least my opinion. You
[10:01] can take it for you can take it however
[10:03] you want. The short answer is I I
[10:06] genuinely have no idea and nobody has
[10:08] any idea. You don't have any idea. I I
[10:10] don't think it makes sense to even try
[10:12] to get overly precise with trying to
[10:16] predict what's going to happen in the
[10:17] future because you you won't be able to
[10:20] predict it. 5 years ago, Meta thought
[10:23] the metaverse was going to be the big
[10:24] thing. It wasn't. You can never predict
[10:26] that. 10, 20 years ago, even if you knew
[10:30] social media was going to get bigger and
[10:32] bigger, would you have predicted that
[10:33] people are going to move away from text
[10:35] posts to image-based posts and then from
[10:38] that they're going to go to like stories
[10:41] and from that they're going to go to
[10:42] short form videos and stuff. You can
[10:43] never predict these sorts of trends. So,
[10:47] I know that the only question many
[10:50] people want answered is what the hell is
[10:52] going to happen? I just want to know if
[10:54] I should be studying this or not, or I
[10:56] just want to know if I should switch
[10:57] careers or not. And I just don't have a
[11:01] really good answer to that. I mean, I
[11:03] can tell you how I approach it and how
[11:04] I'm thinking about this and how I'm
[11:06] seeing other people that I respect and
[11:08] other smart people thinking about this.
[11:10] They and myself are not trying to
[11:14] predict the future. They just have a
[11:16] certain way that they choose to live
[11:18] their life and they're living it. And
[11:20] I'm kind of of the same mindset that I
[11:24] have a bias where I just like to be
[11:26] really really intense and just go really
[11:29] hard. And so when I was in a position
[11:32] where maybe some of you are in that
[11:33] position today when I was in 2022 when I
[11:37] had quit my job at Amazon and I was very
[11:40] low you know I was crying a lot. I
[11:42] didn't know what was going to happen. I
[11:44] felt very dumb. I didn't think I was
[11:46] even ever going to be able to have any
[11:48] sort of white collar job. You know, with
[11:50] the pandemic that was happening, I
[11:51] didn't know if a job was even going to
[11:52] exist. I didn't know if I was ever going
[11:53] to have another interview again. There
[11:55] was just so much uncertainty. All I
[11:57] really wanted was the certainty of that,
[11:59] okay, if I just followed this plan,
[12:01] everything is going to work itself out.
[12:03] Things are going to go great. All I
[12:04] really wanted was the certainty. I
[12:06] didn't even want the highest paying job.
[12:08] I would have taken any job. I just
[12:09] wanted some level of predictability. But
[12:11] when that's taken away from you and you
[12:14] really don't have a good way of getting
[12:16] it back, what do you do? How do you live
[12:19] life? Like, what kind of mindset do you
[12:21] even have that's going to get you
[12:23] through the day? That's going to get you
[12:24] to tomorrow and the day after that and
[12:27] the day after that. How do you do it? I
[12:29] can only speak for myself because
[12:31] obviously it's a personal thing, but
[12:33] this was my attitude. You know how a lot
[12:36] of people people like gambling? People
[12:39] like uncertainty. Actually, when you
[12:41] open up your phone, that's the best part
[12:43] about it. You never know what you're
[12:44] going to find on social media. If you
[12:46] knew exactly what you were going to
[12:47] find, you probably wouldn't open it as
[12:49] frequently. People like the the, you
[12:51] know, scroll, the new post, new reel.
[12:53] What are you going to get? And sometimes
[12:54] it's not good. And sometimes it is good
[12:57] and you get that dopamine hit. Well, you
[13:00] can get the exact same thing from
[13:03] something called thinking. Okay, I'm not
[13:05] being condescending here, but when you
[13:08] think, when you try and you don't really
[13:10] know where you're where you're even
[13:12] going, what direction you're going, but
[13:14] you know, you're just trying your best
[13:15] and you know what you're going to do.
[13:17] You know what the input is going to be,
[13:18] but you don't know what the output is
[13:19] going to be. The brain is like a
[13:21] unpredictable machine. It's not a
[13:22] deterministic machine. You know, you you
[13:25] throw some voltage into that. You
[13:27] concentrate really hard. You start
[13:28] getting little thoughts, right? And
[13:30] let's be honest, if your brain is
[13:32] anything like mine, most of those
[13:33] thoughts are going to be pretty stupid.
[13:35] They're going to be pretty bad thoughts,
[13:37] but you're going to keep thinking once
[13:38] in a while. You're going to get some
[13:40] good thoughts in there. And you might
[13:42] even get some good thoughts that nobody
[13:44] else has had before. What I'm trying to
[13:46] say is that on some level, you can
[13:50] embrace the uncertainty. the mindset
[13:52] that I chose through all my panic and
[13:55] all the, you know, there there was a lot
[13:57] going on honestly in my personal life at
[13:59] that point, which we won't get into.
[14:01] Ain't nobody got time for that. But I I
[14:03] just said to myself, you know what? I
[14:06] don't really care anymore. I I don't
[14:09] know what's going to happen. I couldn't
[14:11] even remember who I was at that point.
[14:12] Like my memory was just like Anyways, I
[14:15] won't get into that, but I just said to
[14:18] myself, you know what? whatever happens,
[14:20] what do I want to do? Like, h how do I
[14:23] want to choose to live my life? And I
[14:25] just said, well, at the very least, I
[14:28] want to try. Even if I fail, even if I
[14:32] fail, even if I starve to death, at
[14:35] least I'm going to do it doing my best
[14:38] because I just want to prove. I just
[14:40] want to see what I'm capable of. I want
[14:42] to see the heights that I can reach. And
[14:45] I'm not scared anymore. I'm not scared
[14:48] of failing because I already accepted
[14:50] that in this moment right now. If if
[14:53] you're struggling or if you don't have a
[14:54] job or whatever your issue is, you're
[14:56] you're already in the fail mode. Let's
[14:59] say you've already failed. So, what are
[15:01] you scared of? It might seem like I'm
[15:04] trying to hype you up to to say, "Well,
[15:06] screw it. Just be the best programmer
[15:09] that you can be." I'm not necessarily
[15:11] trying to tell anybody how to live their
[15:12] life. Everyone has their own
[15:13] circumstances. But this attitude that
[15:16] I've seen a lot of, which is the most
[15:18] self-defeating attitude, which is just
[15:20] this constant anxiety, this constant
[15:23] dread where you don't really know what's
[15:25] going to happen. You know, you have to
[15:26] ask yourself, what's that getting you?
[15:29] You're not getting anywhere by thinking
[15:31] like that. It's just making you feel
[15:33] worse. So, if that's how you want to
[15:35] live your life, that's fine. But when I
[15:38] look around, those people are the most
[15:41] unhappy. the people that still have some
[15:44] anxiety like myself and other people,
[15:47] but they're just living their life.
[15:49] They're living it one day at a time.
[15:51] They are living it how they choose to
[15:53] live by doing the things that they
[15:55] enjoy. The people who enjoy programming
[15:57] and still feel like they're being
[15:59] valuable as programmers. They're doing
[16:01] that. I'm certainly doing that. Like I
[16:03] said, like look at the business that I'm
[16:05] in. I'm in the business of coding
[16:07] interviews. That thing can just change
[16:09] overnight. It's been the case that, you
[16:12] know, everybody's been saying coding
[16:14] interviews are going to go away. You
[16:16] don't think I had any sort of anxiety
[16:17] about that? Of course I did. But I
[16:19] didn't really care that much because
[16:21] even if it goes away, that's not my
[16:24] identity. Coding uh interviews or even
[16:28] programming or even some of these other
[16:31] things, my identity is that, you know,
[16:33] I'm going to sit down and I'm going to
[16:35] compete with anybody because life isn't
[16:38] a competition. I know that's like a
[16:39] toxic way to view things, but it kind of
[16:41] is a competition. And if you're willing
[16:43] to outwork other people, which is how I
[16:46] get a lot of my gratification from that,
[16:48] I'll tell you straight up. People always
[16:50] say you shouldn't compare yourself to
[16:52] other people. Just compare yourself to
[16:53] yourself. I do that, too. You know, I
[16:55] I'm into self-improvement, but you know,
[16:58] beating somebody else, there's a certain
[17:01] gratification you get from that. And
[17:03] when I see people with the attitude of
[17:07] panic and fear and anxiety, well, at
[17:10] first I feel bad for them because I used
[17:12] to be in their same shoes and I know
[17:14] it's not always easy to kind of get
[17:15] through that. But I sincerely think I
[17:19] could compete with anybody. And I think
[17:20] really anyone can. I think at each level
[17:23] that you're willing to do the things
