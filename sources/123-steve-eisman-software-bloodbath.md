# 123: Flight to Safety Begins, Private Credit Cracks & the Software Bloodbath

> **Creator**: Steve Eisman | **Platform**: YouTube | **Date**: 2026-02-20 | **Duration**: 24:41

## Summary

Steve Eisman's weekly market recap for the week ending February 20, 2026 paints a picture of an increasingly stressed market beneath a flat surface. The S&P 500 info sector is down 4% for the year, with the software sub-sector down 20% — driven by AI fears that vibe-coded replacements will destroy SaaS economics. Investors are rotating from growth into staples (up 13% YTD), signaling a flight to safety. Meanwhile, private credit is cracking: Blue Owl restricted redemptions from a retail credit fund, exposing a classic duration mismatch that Eisman warns will cascade across the industry.

On earnings, Eisman highlights Nvidia's upcoming report as likely a non-event despite $650B in combined hyperscaler AI capex guidance for 2026. Software stocks are in such negative sentiment territory that they fall on good, mixed, and bad news alike — Palo Alto Networks beat on revenue and EPS but dropped 6% on mixed guidance. The broader thesis: AI spending is propping up infrastructure plays (Quanta's 20% revenue growth) while devastating the software companies it was supposed to empower. Eisman also flags Moody's as a counterexample — proprietary databases create moats that AI cannot easily breach.

## Key Concepts

### The Software Bloodbath ([05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5Q5lFP9csc&t=330))

Software stocks are down 20% in 2026 alone, with negative sentiment so pervasive that stocks decline regardless of earnings quality. The market narrative has shifted from "AI will boost software productivity" to "AI will replace software companies entirely." Even strong beats like Palo Alto Networks (15% revenue growth, 27% EPS growth) get punished on mixed guidance.

### Private Credit Duration Mismatch ([03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5Q5lFP9csc&t=180))

Blue Owl restricting quarterly redemptions from a private credit fund reveals a structural problem: retail investors can theoretically redeem quarterly, but the underlying loans are illiquid and long-term. Eisman compares this to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and warns it is "far from over" — more fund suspensions are likely as retail investors grow nervous.

### Proprietary Data as AI Moat ([08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5Q5lFP9csc&t=510))

Moody's beat expectations and gave strong 2026 guidance while S&P Global stumbled on AI disruption fears. The difference: Moody's management emphasized the proprietary nature of its databases. When a company owns irreplaceable data, AI inroads become "difficult to impossible" — a key insight for evaluating which businesses are truly threatened by AI.

### Flight to Safety Rotation ([01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5Q5lFP9csc&t=90))

The market is moving from performance chasing to defensive positioning. Staples up 13%, tech down 4%. Eisman notes the irony that staples fundamentals haven't improved (still suffering from inflation and tariffs), but investors are paying up for perceived safety regardless.

### AI Infrastructure as Beneficiary ([11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5Q5lFP9csc&t=660))

While software gets crushed, AI infrastructure plays thrive. Quanta (utility construction for data centers) posted 20% revenue growth. The $650B in combined hyperscaler capex for 2026 (up from $450B in 2025) flows directly to infrastructure, not to the software companies investors feared would be disrupted.

## Practical Takeaways

- **Proprietary data is the real AI moat**: Companies with irreplaceable databases (Moody's, rating agencies) are far more defensible than those whose value AI can replicate.
- **Watch private credit redemptions**: Duration mismatches in retail private credit funds are a systemic risk. More fund suspensions are likely in coming months.
- **Software sentiment is a contrarian signal**: The 20% decline may be overdone — AI fears have created indiscriminate selling regardless of individual company fundamentals.
- **AI capex benefits infrastructure, not software**: Follow the money from hyperscaler spending to utility construction and power companies, not to the SaaS companies the AI narrative supposedly helps.
