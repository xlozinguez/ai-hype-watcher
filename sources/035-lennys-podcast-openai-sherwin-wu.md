# 035: "Engineers are becoming sorcerers" | The future of software development with OpenAI's Sherwin Wu

> **Creator**: Lenny's Podcast (Sherwin Wu) | **Platform**: YouTube | **Date**: 2026-02-12 | **Duration**: 1:19:39

## Summary

Sherwin Wu, who leads developer-facing products at OpenAI, joins Lenny Rachitsky for a wide-ranging conversation about how AI is transforming software engineering from the inside. Wu shares that 95% of OpenAI engineers use Codex and 100% of their PRs are reviewed by Codex, providing a rare insider look at how a frontier AI company dogfoods its own tools. The conversation spans the evolving role of engineers, enterprise AI adoption challenges, the explosion of small startups, and where AI capabilities are heading over the next 12-18 months.

Wu introduces a compelling metaphor for the shift in software engineering: engineers are becoming "sorcerers" who command powerful forces rather than manually writing every line of code. This frames the broader theme of the conversation -- the nature of engineering work is fundamentally changing from writing code to steering, reviewing, and orchestrating AI-generated output. Wu is candid about the gap between Silicon Valley's AI bubble and real-world enterprise adoption, noting that many organizations are still far behind.

The discussion also covers practical advice for enterprise AI adoption (tiger teams, top-down plus bottoms-up buy-in), the economic implications of dramatically cheaper software creation (explosion of small companies and startups), and OpenAI's platform strategy. Wu encourages listeners not to take the current AI wave for granted and to lean in before the window of opportunity closes.

## Key Concepts

### Engineers as Sorcerers: The New Programming Metaphor

Wu draws on a metaphor comparing modern software engineers to sorcerers. ([9:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=540)) The analogy captures how engineers have moved from writing every line of code to commanding AI agents that do the implementation. Like sorcery, you must be precise in your instructions -- the "genie" grants wishes but can go wrong if instructions are vague. ([12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=720)) This connects to the broader vibe-coding phenomenon but frames it as a fundamental shift in the engineering discipline rather than a shortcut.

### OpenAI's Internal AI-Native Engineering Practices

Wu reveals concrete numbers about OpenAI's own adoption: 95% of engineers use Codex, and 100% of PRs are reviewed by Codex. ([0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=0)) Engineers now operate more like managers of parallel AI threads -- checking in, steering direction, and reviewing output rather than writing code directly. ([8:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=480)) The review process has shifted too: AI catches lint errors, suggests improvements, and provides automated PR reviews with suggestions baked in, reducing (but not eliminating) human review time. ([16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=960))

### The Enterprise Adoption Gap

Wu is remarkably candid about the gap between Silicon Valley and the rest of the world. He notes that "Silicon Valley just forgets that we live in a bubble" ([38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=2310)) and that many companies haven't meaningfully adopted AI yet. Successful enterprise deployments require both top-down buy-in (C-suite commitment) and bottoms-up energy from enthusiastic individual contributors. ([40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=2400)) He recommends forming "tiger teams" of the most excited people rather than forcing adoption across the organization. ([41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=2490))

### The Explosion of Small Companies and the "Marginal Cost of Software" Drop

One of Wu's most significant predictions concerns the economic implications of near-zero marginal cost software creation. ([25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=1500)) As it becomes dramatically easier to build software, he anticipates an explosion of small startups and bespoke software companies. ([25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=1530)) This includes a new category of companies -- perhaps million-dollar companies rather than billion-dollar unicorns -- that serve niche markets with highly tailored solutions. ([28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=1680)) These may not be attractive to venture capital but represent a massive economic shift.

### Build for Where the Models Are Going

Wu's core advice to builders on the API is to build for where models are heading, not where they are today. ([1:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=60)) He highlights that scaffolding and tooling built around model limitations (e.g., vector stores in 2023) often gets eaten by model improvements. ([45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=2730)) The practical implication: invest in areas where AI is ~80% there today, because model improvements will close the gap. ([49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=2970)) Over the next 12-18 months, Wu expects significant gains in multi-hour coherent task execution and multimodal capabilities (especially audio in enterprise contexts). ([51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=3090))

### The Bigger Opportunity Beyond Software Engineering

Wu pushes back on the narrow focus on AI for coding, arguing that the majority of work in the economy is not software engineering -- it is procedures, operations, finance, and go-to-market. ([54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=3240)) He sees the real unlock in applying AI agents and frameworks to these domains, which represent far more economic value than developer tooling alone. ([56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=3360))

## Practical Takeaways

- **Form tiger teams for AI adoption**: Instead of mandating org-wide AI use, find the most enthusiastic people and give them resources to demonstrate value. Success requires both top-down executive commitment and bottoms-up grassroots energy. ([40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=2400))
- **Build for 80% capability today**: If a model can handle ~80% of a use case now, invest in building for it -- model improvements will close the remaining gap faster than you expect. ([49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=2970))
- **Steer AI via text artifacts**: Use markdown files, code comments, and structured documents to guide AI agents, rather than relying solely on conversational prompts. ([14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=870))
- **Invest in review, not just generation**: As AI writes more code, the human role shifts to reviewing, steering, and validating. Lean into this -- it is the new core skill. ([15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=930))
- **Top performers pull further ahead**: Wu observes that the best engineers are disproportionately benefiting from AI tools, widening the gap with average performers. ([20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=1230))
- **Don't over-invest in scaffolding**: Tooling built around model limitations tends to get absorbed by model improvements. Keep your architecture flexible. ([45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=2730))
- **Managers should use AI tools too**: Even if managers aren't writing production code, using Codex and similar tools builds intuition and credibility for leading AI-augmented teams. ([19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B26CwKm5C1k&t=1170))
