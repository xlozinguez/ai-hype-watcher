# 033: Why CEOs Are Getting AI Wrong — with Ethan Mollick

> **Creator**: Prof G Conversations (Scott Galloway / Ethan Mollick) | **Platform**: YouTube | **Date**: 2026-02-12 | **Duration**: 54:42

## Summary

Ethan Mollick, Wharton professor and author of the "One Useful Thing" Substack, joins Scott Galloway for a wide-ranging conversation about why enterprise AI adoption is stalling despite significant individual productivity gains. Mollick argues that roughly 50% of American workers already use AI, reporting 3x productivity on tasks they apply it to, but they are hiding this usage from their employers out of fear that demonstrated efficiency will lead to layoffs. ([04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNq_wJHsls&t=270))

The central thesis is that CEOs are making a critical error by framing AI purely as an efficiency play (i.e., headcount reduction) rather than as a capability expansion opportunity. Mollick contrasts Walmart's stated approach of keeping employees and expanding what they do against Amazon's posture of cutting due to AI. He warns that a "failure of imagination" in corporate America could turn AI into a self-fulfilling prophecy of labor destruction rather than growth. ([28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNq_wJHsls&t=1680))

The conversation also covers the competitive landscape among frontier model providers, the geopolitical dynamics of Chinese open-weights models, the breakdown of apprenticeship-based learning, and the three possible endgame scenarios for the AI industry: continued capability racing, takeoff/AGI, or commoditization.

## Key Concepts

### The Hidden Adoption Gap

About 50% of American workers already use AI, but they are not telling their employers. Workers fear that revealing AI-driven efficiency gains will result in headcount cuts. The result is a massive gap between what companies think is happening with AI adoption and what is actually happening. Corporate AI tools go underused while employees quietly use consumer AI products. ([04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNq_wJHsls&t=270))

### Efficiency vs. Capability Expansion

Mollick's core message to CEOs: stop treating AI as a cost-cutting tool and start treating it as a capability multiplier. If one person can do 40% more work, the instinct is to hire 40% fewer people. But the better move is to ask what new things become possible. Coding is the clearest example — 10x more code does not mean 90% fewer coders; it means building things that were previously impossible. The companies succeeding with AI use a "leadership + lab + crowd" model: leadership sets direction and incentives, a dedicated team builds internal tooling, and the entire workforce experiments with frontier tools to discover use cases. ([08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNq_wJHsls&t=510))

### The Apprenticeship Crisis

AI is breaking the traditional apprenticeship model that has trained professionals for thousands of years. Interns now use Claude or ChatGPT to produce work that exceeds their natural skill level, meaning they never develop foundational competencies through repetition and feedback. Meanwhile, middle managers increasingly turn to AI instead of interns because it produces results without the overhead. This creates a dangerous loop where nobody learns entry-level skills informally, increasing the importance of formal education. ([34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNq_wJHsls&t=2070))

### Three Endgame Scenarios for AI

Mollick outlines three possible futures for the AI industry: (1) a continued capability race where companies leapfrog each other and customers pay for the latest frontier model; (2) "takeoff" where one company's models become self-improving and achieve AGI, creating an insurmountable lead; or (3) commoditization where development plateaus, free Chinese open-weights models catch up, and the frontier providers lose their pricing power. ([19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNq_wJHsls&t=1140))

### The Jagged Frontier of Model Capabilities

The three major US frontier providers — OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google — are in a tight race with models leapfrogging on a week-by-week basis. While they converge in capability, each has distinct personality traits: Anthropic's models are the best writers with high ethical standards, OpenAI has strong logical/long-task models, and Gemini is smart overall but "weirdly neurotic." Chinese open-weights models remain roughly 8 months behind the frontier. ([16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNq_wJHsls&t=960))

### AI in Medicine and Research

Mollick highlights medicine as an area with exceptional AI potential: accelerated drug discovery, administrative burden reduction, patient communication (pre-operative forms in plain language improving surgical outcomes), and second opinions. He notes that AI is already finding errors in published academic papers that require running independent Monte Carlo analyses to detect. However, AI-generated content is also "scrambling signals" in peer review, making it harder to distinguish quality research from noise. ([39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNq_wJHsls&t=2370))

## Practical Takeaways

- **Start with 8-10 hours of hands-on use**: Pick any of the big three (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) at the $20/month tier, use their advanced thinking models, and apply AI to tasks you already do at work to map your own jagged frontier. ([12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNq_wJHsls&t=720))
- **Adopt the "leadership + lab + crowd" model**: Leaders set direction and incentives, a dedicated internal team builds AI tooling, and the entire organization gets access to experiment and surface use cases bottom-up. ([08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNq_wJHsls&t=510))
- **Don't fixate on cheaper/older models**: Model costs have dropped 99.9% for equivalent intelligence in 3 years; for most applications, you want the smartest available model, not the cheapest one. ([24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNq_wJHsls&t=1440))
- **Use AI as cross-checker, not first-drafter** (for knowledge work): Mollick writes his own first drafts for voice authenticity, then uses Claude to verify, fact-check, and improve — turning days of work into hours. ([37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNq_wJHsls&t=2220))
- **10x more output ≠ 10x more value**: If AI produces 10x more PowerPoints, that does not translate to company benefit unless leadership rethinks processes around this new capacity. ([06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNq_wJHsls&t=360))

## Notable Quotes

> "About 50% of American workers use AI. They report three times productivity gains on the tasks they use AI for. They're just not giving that to companies. Because why would you? You're worried you'll get fired if AI shows you that you're more efficient." — Ethan Mollick ([04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNq_wJHsls&t=270))

> "My desperate desire is to try and communicate to companies something I think the AI labs try and say, which is this is also about an expansion of capabilities. If you could do more work and different kinds of work, the boundaries of what a firm could do could change." — Ethan Mollick ([28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNq_wJHsls&t=1680))

> "Nobody knows what's going on. I talk to all the AI labs on a regular basis... It's not like there's a playbook out there. We're a thousand days into after the release of ChatGPT. Everyone's figuring this out at the same time." — Ethan Mollick ([08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNq_wJHsls&t=480))

> "10 times more code doesn't mean we should have 90% less coders. Maybe that means we can do different things than we could do before." — Ethan Mollick ([29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNq_wJHsls&t=1740))

> "There's no better model than the ones you have access to today. You or every kid in Mozambique has access to the exact same tools that are at Goldman Sachs or Department of Defense." — Ethan Mollick ([11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNq_wJHsls&t=690))
