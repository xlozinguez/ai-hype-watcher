# 159: Two Years of Vibe Coding — Why AI-Generated Codebases Fall Apart

> **Creator**: Mo Bitar | **Platform**: YouTube | **Date**: 2026-01-23 | **Duration**: 11:54

## Summary

Mo Bitar documents his two-year journey through the evolution of AI-assisted coding and explains why he ultimately returned to writing code by hand. He traces a common arc: starting with ambitious prompts, failing, blaming prompt quality, writing increasingly detailed specifications, narrowing scope to tiny tasks, believing the approach finally works — only to discover upon actually reading the accumulated codebase that the code is "a psychedelic, highly plausible set of hallucinations."

The core argument is that AI-generated code consistently passes a dangerous "diff-level review" — individual changes look reasonable in isolation — but produces codebases that are incoherent when read as a whole. Bitar argues this creates a fundamental accountability gap: someone must sign off on code that handles user data, funds, and safety-critical operations, and you cannot responsibly do so without understanding what is inside the codebase.

## Key Concepts

### The Deception Cycle of AI Coding

AI coding tools systematically fool developers through a pattern: the user prompts the AI, corrects it, gets a dopamine hit from validation when the AI appears to understand their intent, and concludes the AI "coded something" — when in reality the user did the structural thinking and the AI filled in templates. This cycle operates at every level of specification complexity, from one-line prompts to detailed markdown specs.

### The Diff-Level Illusion

Individual diffs and pull requests generated by AI always look reasonable because they are designed to "fit into a hole." The problem only surfaces when you open the actual files and read the code end-to-end. Bitar describes discovering that code he had reviewed change-by-change over months was "complete gibberish" — fully functional, passing all tests, but architecturally incoherent and unmaintainable.

### Responsibility and Value Judgment

The engineering discipline of software development is fundamentally about human accountability. When a manager asks "is this code safe to ship?", a developer cannot outsource that judgment to Claude. There will always be real money, real data, and real liability on the line. The idea that "full self-driving for software development" has arrived is "completely delusionary."

## Practical Takeaways

- **Read your whole codebase, not just diffs**: Periodically open and read source files end-to-end rather than reviewing only incremental changes, which always look reasonable in isolation.
- **Passing tests is not enough**: AI-generated code can achieve 100% test pass rates with good coverage while still producing architecturally unsound code that no developer would sign off on.
- **Your job is safe**: Anyone who has spent 8+ hours per day using AI coding agents over the past year is not worried about losing their job — the tools are useful but far from autonomous.

## Notable Quotes

> "You owe yourself to open up the code that you haven't probably looked at in a long time because you've been so busy vibing. Open it up and see what you're shipping to users and notice that it's just a psychedelic, highly plausible set of hallucinations." — Mo Bitar

> "There's a sense of value and ownership that only humans can decree and impart. And that is something that is extremely important to the engineering discipline of software development." — Mo Bitar

> "This idea that we've invented full self-driving for software development is completely delusionary, is a complete pipe dream and a very dangerous one." — Mo Bitar
