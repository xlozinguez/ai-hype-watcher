# 145: Is Google allowed be mad at this?

> **Creator**: The PrimeTime | **Platform**: YouTube | **Date**: 2026-02-23 | **Duration**: 6:37

## Summary

Prime reacts to Google DeepMind and the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG) publishing an executive summary about increased model extraction and distillation attacks against their AI models. He highlights the deep irony of Google — a company built on scraping the world's data for pre-training — now crying intellectual property theft when others use their model outputs for instruction tuning.

The video extends the critique to OpenAI, which frames its position around "democratic AI" while keeping its models proprietary. Prime argues that the real motivation behind both companies' complaints is not ethics or democracy but market dominance and protecting the bottom line.

## Key Concepts

### Model Distillation as "Behavioral Cloning" ([00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9WB2xbM5sc&t=46))

Prime explains the two-phase training pipeline (pre-training on raw data, then instruction tuning with Q&A pairs) and how distillation works: competitors query models like ChatGPT and use the responses as instruction-tuning data. This produces "behavioral cloning" — mimicking output behavior without the nuance of pre-training. Google and OpenAI claim this constitutes IP theft.

### The Irony of Google Claiming IP Theft ([01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9WB2xbM5sc&t=60))

Google, one of the primary companies that scraped the world's data for pre-training — violating countless terms of service in the process — is now publishing formal complaints about others stealing their intellectual property. Prime calls this "one of the most rich ironies I have ever seen."

### "Democratic AI" as Market Control ([05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9WB2xbM5sc&t=340))

OpenAI frames the competition as "democratic AI vs. the Chinese Communist Party," but Prime argues this is cover for wanting to be the sole provider of AI. The real message: democratic AI that only we can provide for you.

## Practical Takeaways

- **Ethics are selectively applied**: Large AI companies invoke IP protections only when they are the ones being copied, not when they do the copying
- **Distillation is a real competitive threat**: Behavioral cloning via API queries is a known technique that allows smaller players to approximate frontier model capabilities cheaply
- **Follow the incentives**: When companies talk about "democratic AI" or "ethical AI," examine whether the underlying motive is market control

## Notable Quotes

> "The company in which has stolen the world's data to sell back to us in the form of generative AI is upset because there is someone stealing from the generative AI." — The PrimeTime ([00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9WB2xbM5sc&t=48))

> "It's not about the democratic AI and everybody gets AI. It's about the democratic AI that only I can provide for you." — The PrimeTime ([05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9WB2xbM5sc&t=335))

> "When Google cries intellectual property theft, not going to lie, I don't shed a single tear." — The PrimeTime ([05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9WB2xbM5sc&t=357))
