# 019: Something Big Is Happening

> **Creator**: Matt Shumer | **Platform**: Blog | **Date**: 2026-02-09 | **Duration**: ~8 min read

## Summary

Matt Shumer describes a world where AI systems now autonomously complete complex software projects without human intervention, and argues that this represents a qualitative break from everything that came before. The article traces a rapid progression: in 2022, AI could not reliably do basic arithmetic; by 2023, it passed the bar exam; by 2024, it wrote working software and explained graduate-level science; and as of February 2026, the latest models (GPT-5.3 Codex, Claude Opus 4.6) demonstrate something Shumer characterizes as "judgment" and "taste" -- the ability to make architectural decisions, iterate on their own output, and produce work that previously required experienced human engineers.

The most sobering data point comes from METR, which tracks AI task completion capacity. The time AI can work autonomously before needing human help has been doubling every 7 months, and that rate is accelerating to every 4 months. Models can now handle tasks requiring roughly 5 hours of human expert effort. At this trajectory, autonomous multi-day work is months away, not years. Shumer also highlights the self-improvement loop: GPT-5.3 Codex was instrumental in creating itself, and Anthropic's CEO says AI writes "much of the code" at Anthropic. The article closes with practical recommendations -- subscribe to paid AI services, integrate AI into real work, build financial resilience, dedicate time daily to experimentation -- framed not as career optimization but as preparation for a fundamental restructuring of knowledge work.

## Key Concepts

### The Qualitative Leap in Recent Models

Shumer argues that GPT-5.3 Codex and Claude Opus 4.6, both released on February 5, 2026, represent more than incremental improvement. These models demonstrate "judgment" -- the ability to make contextually appropriate decisions without explicit instruction -- and can iterate autonomously on complex projects. The distinction is not that they write more code or write it faster, but that they can sustain coherent work across the kind of multi-step, multi-file tasks that previously required a human engineer's ongoing involvement. This is the difference between a better tool and a different category of collaborator.

### The Doubling Rate Is Accelerating

METR data shows AI task completion capacity (measured by how long a model can work autonomously before needing human intervention) has been doubling every 7 months. Recently, that rate has compressed to every 4 months. The current capability is roughly 5 hours of autonomous expert-level work. Extrapolating even conservatively, autonomous multi-day work is a near-term reality. This is not speculative -- it is a measured trend with consistent data points, and the acceleration means projections based on the 7-month doubling rate are already too conservative.

### The Self-Improvement Loop

A critical threshold has been crossed: AI is now meaningfully contributing to its own development. OpenAI documented that GPT-5.3 Codex was "instrumental in creating itself." Dario Amodei predicts full AI autonomy in AI development within 1-2 years. This creates a feedback loop where each generation of AI helps build the next generation faster, which then helps build the generation after that even faster. Shumer frames this as the mechanism that could turn linear progress into exponential acceleration -- and notes that it is already happening, not a theoretical future scenario.

### General-Purpose Cognitive Replacement

Unlike previous automation waves that targeted specific, narrow skills (manufacturing robots replacing assembly tasks, ATMs replacing bank tellers), AI substitutes for broad cognitive work -- reading, analyzing, writing, deciding, coding, designing. This simultaneity across domains means there is no convenient adjacent field to retrain into. Legal, finance, software engineering, medicine, writing, and customer service are all affected concurrently. Shumer argues this makes the standard "retrain for the new economy" advice inadequate.

### The 50% Entry-Level Prediction

Dario Amodei predicts 50% elimination of entry-level white-collar jobs within 1-5 years. Shumer notes that industry observers suggest this may be conservative. The jobs most at risk are those defined by executing well-scoped cognitive tasks -- exactly the tasks AI has gotten dramatically better at. The jobs that persist will be those requiring relationship trust, physical presence, licensed accountability, or the kind of strategic judgment that comes from deep domain experience.

### The Window of Advantage

Shumer identifies a brief period -- possibly months, not years -- where individuals who aggressively adopt AI tools gain a significant competitive edge. This window closes as adoption becomes universal. The analogy is not "learn to use email" (where late adopters caught up easily) but rather a compressed land-rush where early movers establish positions that are difficult to replicate once the window closes.

## Practical Takeaways

- **Subscribe to paid AI services now**: The gap between free-tier and paid-tier AI tools is significant and growing. At $20/month, paid subscriptions to Claude Pro or ChatGPT Plus provide access to frontier models that are qualitatively different from free alternatives.
- **Integrate AI into real work, not experiments**: Using AI for casual queries or isolated experiments does not build the intuition needed to restructure workflows. Apply AI to your actual daily tasks -- the uncomfortable, messy integration is where the learning happens.
- **Dedicate 1 hour daily to AI experimentation**: Consistent daily practice builds fluency faster than occasional deep dives. Shumer frames this not as optional professional development but as essential preparation.
- **Build financial resilience**: Reduce fixed-cost obligations where possible. The near-term job market for knowledge workers is likely to be volatile, and financial flexibility provides the runway to adapt.
- **Focus career development on judgment, not execution**: Roles that survive will emphasize relationship trust, architectural thinking, strategic decisions, and licensed accountability -- not the execution of well-scoped cognitive tasks.
- **Track the METR doubling rate**: This is the single most informative metric for calibrating expectations about AI capability timelines.
