# 089: Nvidia Losing Confidence In OpenAI

> **Creator**: Wall Street Millennial | **Platform**: YouTube | **Date**: 2026-02-16 | **Duration**: 17:50

## Summary

Wall Street Millennial examines the unraveling of Nvidia's announced $100 billion investment in OpenAI, using it as a lens to scrutinize OpenAI's broader infrastructure ambitions and Sam Altman's recurring narrative of AI-driven scientific breakthroughs. The video traces the timeline from the September 2025 announcement of a "strategic partnership" to deploy 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems, through Wall Street Journal reporting that Nvidia slow-walked the deal, to Jensen Huang's February 2026 press conference where he effectively confirmed the original deal would not proceed as announced.

The analysis reveals a pattern of unfunded megaprojects: Project Stargate (the $500 billion joint venture with Oracle and SoftBank) had completed only 2% of its target by end of 2025, and neither Nvidia nor OpenAI has experience building or operating large data centers. Rather than finishing Stargate, OpenAI announced a second 10-gigawatt initiative with Nvidia — neither having secured funding. The video systematically dismantles Altman's claim that more compute will "cure cancer," pointing out that OpenAI's only science-specific tool (Prism) is essentially a text editor, that LLMs are fundamentally limited to regurgitating training data patterns, and that OpenAI's showcase partnership with Ginkgo Bioworks produced no new drugs despite years of AI-driven research claims while Ginkgo's stock declined 97%.

The broader thesis is that Nvidia and Microsoft need to keep OpenAI alive to sustain the AI bubble and their own stock valuations, but that private sentiment (Jensen Huang criticizing OpenAI's "lack of discipline" and ChatGPT losing market share) diverges sharply from the public narrative of bullish AI infrastructure investment.

## Key Concepts

### The Unfunded Megaproject Pattern

OpenAI has announced two separate 10-gigawatt data center initiatives — Project Stargate ($500B with Oracle/SoftBank) and the Nvidia partnership ($100B) — neither of which has secured funding. Stargate completed only 2% (200 MW in Abilene, Texas) by end of 2025. OpenAI's own CFO stated that a single gigawatt costs $50 billion to build, meaning Nvidia's $100 billion would cover only 20% of the 10-gigawatt target. The remaining $400 billion has no identified source. This pattern of announcing massive commitments without binding agreements or funding is central to the AI infrastructure hype cycle.

### The Compute-to-Cure Narrative as Marketing Artifice

Altman repeatedly claims that with enough compute (5 gigawatts), OpenAI could "cure cancer." The video systematically deconstructs this: OpenAI already has 2 gigawatts and has produced no medical breakthroughs; its science-specific tool Prism is a text formatting editor; LLMs are limited to regurgitating patterns from training data and cannot make novel scientific discoveries absent from their training corpus; and OpenAI's partnership with Ginkgo Bioworks — touted as evidence of AI-driven biology — produced no new drugs while Ginkgo's stock fell 97%. Meanwhile, OpenAI spends billions on Sora (a video generator with "minuscule revenue"), contradicting the claim of being compute-constrained for scientific work.

### Public vs. Private Sentiment in AI Leadership

Jensen Huang publicly calls Wall Street Journal reporting "nonsense" while effectively confirming it in the same press conference — pivoting from a $100 billion direct investment to a smaller participation in OpenAI's upcoming funding round. The video highlights that Huang has privately criticized OpenAI's "lack of discipline" and expressed concerns about ChatGPT losing market share to Google Gemini and Anthropic's Claude. This gap between public bullishness and private skepticism extends to the broader AI ecosystem, where major players must maintain the narrative to support their own valuations.

### OpenAI's IP and Copyright Strategy

The video surfaces OpenAI's approach to training data: scraping content from thousands of websites without licensing deals, with the notable exception of Reddit — where Altman personally profits through his venture capital firm Hydrazine's stake in Reddit stock. The Studio Ghibli case illustrates the pattern: OpenAI scraped Ghibli's distinctive animation style for ChatGPT's image generator without any disclosed licensing agreement, while Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki had previously called AI animation "an insult to life itself."

## Practical Takeaways

- **Verify funding commitments**: Non-binding letters of intent are not investments. When evaluating AI infrastructure claims, check whether funding is actually secured or merely announced
- **Apply the revenue test to breakthrough claims**: If a company claims transformative scientific capability, ask whether it has produced any revenue-generating scientific product. OpenAI has not, despite having 2 gigawatts of compute already
- **Watch for public-private sentiment divergence**: When executives publicly praise a deal while privately slow-walking it, the private behavior is the more reliable signal
- **Track completion rates on megaprojects**: Stargate's 2% completion rate after a year provides a concrete baseline for evaluating AI infrastructure timelines

## Notable Quotes

> "According to Altman, with 5 gigawatt of compute, OpenAI can cure cancer. With the other 5 gigawatts, they will provide education to every kid on Earth." — Wall Street Millennial

> "ChatGPT cannot tell you how to cure cancer because a cure for cancer does not exist in its training data." — Wall Street Millennial

> "The likes of Nvidia and Microsoft need to keep OpenAI alive so as to keep the AI bubble going and support their own stock market valuations." — Wall Street Millennial
