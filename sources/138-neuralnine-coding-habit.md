# 138: I Started A Coding Habit & You Should Too...

> **Creator**: NeuralNine | **Platform**: YouTube | **Date**: 2026-02-18 | **Duration**: 16:47

## Summary

NeuralNine advocates for a daily coding habit that is deliberately goal-free — not tied to work, deadlines, or content creation. The habit involves spending 30-60 minutes daily coding or studying for pure interest, inspired by Peter Steinburger's (OpenClaw creator) prolific GitHub activity. The creator demonstrates two personal projects built through this practice: a multimodal image asset search tool using CLIP embeddings, and an email inbox visualization tool.

The video provides a grounded perspective on the relationship between AI-assisted coding and foundational skills. NeuralNine describes using Claude Code to scaffold applications after first understanding the core logic manually — a workflow that contrasts with pure vibe coding by emphasizing comprehension before delegation.

## Key Concepts

### Goal-Free Coding Practice ([00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pWXbXjRdQE&t=0))

The habit is intentionally not goal-oriented: no deadlines, no client requirements, no content production targets. The purpose is intrinsic enjoyment and organic skill growth. Projects should scratch a personal itch rather than chase market opportunities.

### Understand First, Delegate Second ([10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pWXbXjRdQE&t=602))

NeuralNine's approach to AI-assisted development: manually experiment with the core technology (inference APIs, vector stores, embedding models), understand the logic, then feed reference files to Claude Code with instructions to scaffold the full application. This preserves comprehension while leveraging AI for boilerplate.

### Multimodal Embedding Side Project ([04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pWXbXjRdQE&t=282))

"Latent Assets" uses Jina CLIP v2 to create a searchable image asset library. Images and text share the same embedding space, enabling semantic search without manual annotation. The tool solves a real workflow problem — finding thumbnail assets without repeated Google searches.

### Compounding Benefits of Side Projects ([14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pWXbXjRdQE&t=840))

Side projects compound in multiple directions: video ideas, portfolio pieces, GitHub activity, potential SaaS products, and genuine skill development. The key is that these are organic byproducts, not the primary motivation. In an era where many developers rely entirely on AI, maintaining hands-on fundamentals becomes a differentiator.

## Practical Takeaways

- **Reserve 30-60 minutes daily** for coding/studying that has no external deliverable — treat it like exercise for engineering skills
- **Understand before delegating**: Manually work through core logic, then use AI to scaffold the full application around your reference implementation
- **Build for an audience of one**: Solve your own problems first; products and content can emerge organically
- **Study foundations in the age of vibe coding**: Revisiting math, ML theory, and architecture principles becomes more valuable when everyone else is skipping them

## Notable Quotes

> "I'm just coding for fun because coding is something that I like a lot. And when I do it with a purpose in mind, it is still enjoyable, but it's more about achieving something than coding for fun." — NeuralNine ([00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pWXbXjRdQE&t=42))

> "I told it look I know how to do this. Here are three files that I wrote... and build a FastAPI application around it... This is how I built this." — NeuralNine ([10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pWXbXjRdQE&t=647))

> "Having good linear algebra skills, it's just nice when you read papers... especially in an age where everyone is just vibe coding." — NeuralNine ([03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pWXbXjRdQE&t=192))
