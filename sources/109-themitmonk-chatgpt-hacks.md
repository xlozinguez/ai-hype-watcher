# 109: 5 Hacks To Use ChatGPT So Well It's Almost Unfair

## Summary

A CEO and tech investor shares five strategies for getting more value from ChatGPT, framed through historical and mythological analogies. The core insight is that most users treat ChatGPT as a stateless tool when it can function as a persistent, context-aware system. The video covers persistent context management through custom instructions and projects, using agent mode and visual inputs for parallel task execution, adversarial prompting to counter confirmation bias, structured learning techniques, and using voice mode as an executive coaching tool.

While the strategies themselves are straightforward and largely well-known to power users, the "ESP" framework (Extract, Synthesize, Projects) for building persistent context is a practical formalization of context engineering principles. The video targets business professionals and executives rather than developers, making it a useful lens on how non-technical users are adopting AI workflows.

## Key Concepts

### The Clone (ESP Framework)

A three-step process for building persistent ChatGPT context: Extract (voice-mode interview to capture background, tone, strategy, blind spots), Synthesize (organize transcript into a structured summary for custom instructions), Projects (domain-separated workspaces with uploaded files and customized instructions). This transforms ChatGPT from a stateless chat into a context-persistent system.

### The Swarm (Parallel Task Execution)

Using ChatGPT's agent mode, visual analysis, and deep research capabilities as parallel "arms" that handle different work simultaneously. The practical example: a CTO uploading 300 pages of data center presentations and getting analysis in one afternoon that would have previously taken weeks of analyst time.

### The Devil's Advocate (Adversarial Prompting)

Countering ChatGPT's default agreeableness by explicitly prompting for adversarial analysis. Three techniques: magic triggers ("audit using first principles," "act as my fierce competitor"), shadow boxing (simulated debates between opposing personas), and blind spot checks ("based on what you know about me, what are the gaps in my reasoning?").

## Practical Takeaways

- **Build persistent context before asking questions**: Use the ESP framework to front-load ChatGPT with your background, preferences, and domain files so every conversation starts from a richer baseline.
- **Separate projects by domain**: Don't mix consulting, personal, and health contexts. Domain-separated projects prevent context contamination and enable specialized instructions per workspace.
- **Force adversarial feedback**: ChatGPT defaults to validation. Use explicit prompts like "audit this using first principles" or simulate debates between opposing personas to surface blind spots.
- **Use progressive depth for learning**: Ask for explanations at three levels (5-year-old, 15-year-old, college student) to build genuine understanding rather than superficial fluency.
- **Use voice mode for unstructured thinking**: Ranting into voice mode and asking ChatGPT to organize the chaos into actionable categories (solve today, delegate, ignore) is an effective way to process overwhelm.
