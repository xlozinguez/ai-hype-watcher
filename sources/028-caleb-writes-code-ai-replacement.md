# 028: Will AI REPLACE Software Developers..?

> **Creator**: Caleb Writes Code | **Platform**: YouTube | **Date**: 2026-02-11 | **Duration**: 8:27

## Summary

Caleb presents a data-driven analysis of the developer job market, using the Indeed Hiring Lab's job posting index to contextualize the "will AI replace developers" question against concrete labor market trends. His central argument is nuanced: the US developer job market is recovering toward pre-pandemic baselines but has not yet returned to February 2020 levels, and the simultaneous rise of AI coding agents introduces a genuine question about whether that baseline is even the right target anymore.

The video maps the timeline of major AI model releases (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, o1, DeepSeek, Opus 4, Gemini 3) and the emergence of coding agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex) onto the Indeed hiring index, showing a visual tug-of-war between natural market recovery and AI-driven disruption. Caleb highlights a K-shaped divergence among developers: those who fully orchestrate work through AI agents versus those who use AI only as a peripheral tool. He identifies trust and workflow resistance as the two primary barriers to adoption, and notes that entry-level developers in the 18-34 age bracket are bearing the brunt of the market contraction. The video ends as an open question rather than a definitive prediction, asking whether AI will replace developers or create even more demand.

## Key Concepts

### The Indeed Hiring Index Misunderstanding

Caleb corrects a common misreading of the Indeed Hiring Lab chart ([01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqJjAzYXGc&t=76)). The y-axis index of 100 represents the pre-pandemic baseline anchored in February 2020, with values adjusted for seasonality. At the 2022 peak, the index hit 234 — meaning hiring was 134% above normal, not that 234 jobs existed. The current US value of 69 does not mean "only 69 jobs"; it means hiring activity is still 31% below the pre-pandemic norm ([02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqJjAzYXGc&t=128)). Countries like Australia (122) and Canada (78) are closer to or exceeding their baselines, while Germany (58) and the UK (63) trail further behind.

### The Shifting Baseline Question

Overlaying the timeline of flagship AI model releases onto the hiring index reveals a fundamental question: is the pre-pandemic hiring baseline still valid? ([02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqJjAzYXGc&t=152)). The massive hiring bubble of 2021-2022 was followed by layoffs starting late 2022, which happened to coincide with the launch of ChatGPT. Whether the market is recovering toward 100 or settling at a new, lower equilibrium because AI genuinely reduces headcount demand is the core unresolved tension. Caleb frames this as a "tug-of-war" between natural market correction and structural AI disruption ([03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqJjAzYXGc&t=201)).

### K-Shaped Developer Divergence

Drawing on the DORA report and industry commentary, Caleb identifies a K-shaped split in AI adoption among developers ([03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqJjAzYXGc&t=235)). One cohort fully embraces agentic workflows — orchestrating multiple AI agents and shifting from writing code to spec-driven development. The other cohort uses AI minimally, treating it as a moderate automation assist. He cites Uncle Bob's observation that managing three agents made him the bottleneck in his own coding process ([04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqJjAzYXGc&t=245)), and Andrej Karpathy's similar sentiment about feeling "behind" as a programmer using AI agents ([04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqJjAzYXGc&t=254)). Meanwhile, 52% of developers still do not use AI agents at all ([06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqJjAzYXGc&t=397)).

### The Role Demand Shift

The demand shift is not uniform across engineering roles. Machine learning engineers saw nearly 40% growth in demand, data engineers saw 10% growth, while front-end and mobile engineers experienced more than 5% shrinkage from 2024 to 2025 ([06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqJjAzYXGc&t=364)). This suggests AI is not simply reducing developer demand across the board but reshaping which developer roles are valued — pulling demand toward AI-adjacent specialties and away from implementation-heavy roles that AI agents can increasingly handle.

### Trust and Workflow as Adoption Barriers

Caleb identifies two key barriers driving the K-shaped split ([06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqJjAzYXGc&t=412)). First, trust: a large majority of developers simply do not trust AI output for their coding needs, though this will improve as models get better. Second, and more fundamentally, workflow resistance: coding with AI agents (Claude Code, Codex) requires a complete shift from writing code to orchestrating tasks via specifications ([07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqJjAzYXGc&t=443)). This is "vastly different" from copy-pasting into a chat or using extension-based assistants. The Codex app, for example, does not even show code in the main interface — it abstracts implementation entirely ([07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqJjAzYXGc&t=475)).

## Practical Takeaways

- **Read hiring data carefully**: The Indeed index is relative to a February 2020 baseline, not absolute job counts. A value of 69 means 31% below pre-pandemic norms, not a catastrophic collapse.
- **Question the baseline**: The pre-pandemic hiring baseline may no longer be the right target if AI genuinely changes headcount economics. Watch for whether recovery plateaus below 100.
- **Recognize the K-shaped split**: The developer population is diverging into those who orchestrate AI agents and those who use AI peripherally. The gap between these cohorts is widening as tools mature.
- **Expect role specialization shifts**: ML engineering and data engineering demand is growing; front-end and mobile demand is shrinking. Consider upskilling toward AI-adjacent roles.
- **Address workflow, not just tooling**: The biggest barrier to AI adoption is not the tools themselves but the fundamental workflow change from "writing code" to "orchestrating agents via specifications."

## Notable Quotes

> "Is this an early sign that maybe we will never reach back to the pre-pandemic level and we now need a different baseline than February 2020?" — Caleb Writes Code ([03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqJjAzYXGc&t=206))

> "There's been this K-shaped divergence between developers who orchestrate their work entirely using AI and developers who use AI merely as a tool." — Caleb Writes Code ([03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqJjAzYXGc&t=235))

> "Coding with AI, and I mean actually letting AI do the majority of the work, requires a complete change in how you actually work." — Caleb Writes Code ([07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqJjAzYXGc&t=443))

> "Cloud Code and Codex is meant to abstract away the implementation, which changes the rule of the game from coding to what's called spec-driven development." — Caleb Writes Code ([07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqJjAzYXGc&t=467))
