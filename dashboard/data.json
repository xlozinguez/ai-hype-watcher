The video is positioned as a follow-up to his earlier agent teams demo ([004](004-bart-slodyczka-agent-teams.md)), shifting from \"look what this can do\" to \"here's how to use it properly.\"  The core pedagogical contribution is a clear three-mode mental model for Claude Code usage: default mode (single session), sub-agent mode (delegated tasks within one session), and agent teams mode (multiple independent sessions with peer communication).",
