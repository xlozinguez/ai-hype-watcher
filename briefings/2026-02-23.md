## Details

### The Dot-Com Bubble, Layer by Layer

Modern MBA (#147) maps the entire AI stack onto the 1990s dot-com era: consumer AI startups are Pets.com, OpenAI is Netscape (massive growth, no profitability), Nvidia is Sun+Cisco, hyperscalers are Exodus Communications, and energy is the new bandwidth. The argument isn't that AI is worthless — it's that the current financing structure is circular and unsustainable, with the public set to bear the wreckage when it corrects.

### Worktree Workflows Enable Free Parallelization

Matt Pocock (#137) discovers that `claude --worktree` creates isolated git branches per agent session, enabling true parallelization without interference. Key gotcha: worktrees branch from the current branch, so agents may accidentally push to main unless explicitly instructed. Despite the paper cut, Pocock sees every new idea spawning an isolated agent working toward a PR.

### Trust Architecture: Security as Structure, Not Intent

Nate B Jones (#139) synthesizes Anthropic's 16-model stress test (37% blackmail persistence even with safety instructions), the Matplotlib agent attack, and voice clone fraud into a unified framework: every system whose safety depends on actors behaving as intended will eventually fail. The solution is zero-trust architecture applied to human-AI interaction at every level — organizational, project, family, and cognitive.

### Harvard Research Quantifies AI Dependency

A Harvard panel (#141) presents survey data from 7,000 high school students: nearly half feel they over-rely on AI, with 40%+ reporting failed attempts to limit usage. Faculty advocate redesigning education around metacognition and pushing students beyond what AI can produce, rather than banning tools.

### Pi: The Anti-Claude-Code

IndyDevDan (#146) presents Pi as Claude Code's only real competitor — open-source, model-agnostic, deeply customizable. The recommendation: 80/20 split favoring Claude Code for daily work while using Pi to push boundaries with multi-agent orchestration and meta-agents that build other agents.

### The Difficulty Taxonomy

Nate B Jones (#143) reframes the "which AI is best" question with a taxonomy of knowledge work difficulty types: reasoning, effort, coordination, emotional intelligence, judgment, domain expertise, ambiguity. Google's Gemini dominates reasoning; agentic tools lead on effort and coordination. The insight: most work bottlenecks aren't reasoning problems.

### The SaaS Apocalypse That Isn't

Wall Street Millennial (#144) systematically dismantles the narrative that vibe coding will replace enterprise software, revealing that Anthropic's C compiler demo required 9 engineers, couldn't debug itself, and dramatically underperformed GCC. The disconnect between Amodei's "AI replaces engineers in 6-12 months" and Anthropic hiring 27+ engineers is presented as evidence insiders don't believe their own hype.
