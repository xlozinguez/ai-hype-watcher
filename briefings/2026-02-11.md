## Headlines

- **[tools]** Claude Opus 4.6 and GPT-5.3 Codex ship same day, marking the closest head-to-head release in AI history
- **[patterns]** Agent Teams and multi-agent orchestration move from experimental to practical — 16 agents built a C compiler in 2 weeks
- **[security]** Skills ecosystem faces supply chain crisis — 36% of public skills contain security flaws
- **[economics]** Global inference infrastructure is physically constrained with no relief expected before 2028
- **[critical]** AI companies dominate Super Bowl LX advertising, echoing dot-com and crypto bubble patterns

## Details

### Same-Day Model Release Arms Race

Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.6 and OpenAI's GPT-5.3 Codex launched within 20 minutes of each other on February 5, 2026. Opus 4.6 introduced adaptive thinking, 1M token context windows, agent teams with peer-to-peer messaging, and context compaction. GPT-5.3 brought combined coding+reasoning and interactive steering. Benchmark convergence is real — each company addressed its historical weaknesses by borrowing from the other's playbook.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration Goes Production

The C compiler milestone stands out: 16 Opus 4.6 agents working for two weeks produced ~100K lines of Rust that compiles the Linux kernel, PostgreSQL, and other major projects. Cost: $20K. Rakuten deployed Opus 4.6 on their issue tracker — it autonomously closed 13 issues and routed 12 more in a single day across a 50-person engineering org. Meanwhile, Anthropic's own vulnerability research found 500+ zero-day vulnerabilities using Claude in a VM with no special instructions.

### Skills Security Is a Real Problem

The Snyk ToxicSkills study found 76 confirmed malicious payloads among 3,984 skills on ClawHub and skills.sh. Attack vectors include supply chain manipulation, hidden HTML comments with malicious instructions, and "hallucination squatting" — a new class of attack where LLM-generated fake package names are registered by attackers. The skills ecosystem is growing faster than security practices can keep up.

### Infrastructure Constraints Are Real and Physical

DRAM prices spiking 50-60% quarterly, HBM sold out, TSMC advanced nodes fully allocated, Nvidia GPUs on 6+ month lead times. A heavy-use knowledge worker with agentic systems consumes 25-100B tokens/year — at scale, this means billions in annual inference costs. Efficiency isn't optional; it's competitive advantage.

### The Hype Check Remains Important

15 AI spots at Super Bowl LX (23% of all ads) follows the exact pattern of dot-com (2000) and crypto (2022) advertising — both preceded crashes. JPMorgan estimates the AI bubble is 17x bigger than dot-com. Counter-argument: AI investors have the strongest balance sheets in market history, and enterprises are deploying for real tasks. Both things are true.
