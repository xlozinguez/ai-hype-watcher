**Method**: Screenshot analysis → theme gap mapping → top 3 candidate selection → URL resolution → ingestion

**Searched/Reviewed**:
- IMG_4220 — "How To Master Claude Code" cheat sheet (no gap)
- IMG_4222 + IMG_4223 — Matt Stein, Product & Design Exec using CC (cross-functional persona gap noted)
- IMG_4224 — "Claude Cowork Plugins" 53-page guide (non-engineering skills, out of scope)
- IMG_4225 — Eddie Aftandilian, GitHub Agentic Workflows (**ingested as 069**)
- Screenshot 1.48.12 PM — Harry Stebbings / ElevenLabs (no alignment, skipped)
- Screenshot 10.03.20 PM — Jeremy McEntire, multi-agent experiment (**ingested as 068**)
- Screenshot 10.31.40 AM — Matthew Peters, "Stop Vibe Coding" (no gap, reinforces existing themes)
- Screenshot 10.32.01 AM — Noah Brown, tool consolidation (gap noted but not ingested)
- Screenshot 10.32.28 AM — Piotr Domek, "AI coding trap" (gap noted but not ingested)
- Screenshot 10.40.00 AM — Dhyey Mavani, "Handoff Drift" (**ingested as 070**)
- Screenshot 10.47.49 AM — Andrew Boyagi, Atlassian DevEx stats (no gap)

**Ingested** (3 sources):
- **068** — Jeremy McEntire: Organizational Physics of Multi-Agent Systems (empirical swarm failure data, PACT framework)
- **069** — Eddie Aftandilian: GitHub Agentic Workflows (continuous agentic pressure, 100+ workflows)
- **070** — Dhyey Mavani: Handoff Drift (PM-as-prototyper, experimentation velocity)

**Gaps identified but not ingested** (signal tracked):
- Tool consolidation narrative (Claude Code replacing 5+ tools) — Noah Brown
- Clean code as AI prerequisite — Piotr Domek
- Cross-functional personas (PM/design using CC) — Matt Stein, Noah Brown
